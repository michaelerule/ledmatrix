        Post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate protein activity, stability and interaction profiles and are critical for cellular functioning. Further regulation is gained through PTM interplay whereby modifications modulate the occurrence of other PTMs or act in combination. Integration of global acetylation, ubiquitination and tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphorylation datasets with protein interaction data identified hundreds of protein complexes that selectively accumulate each PTM, indicating coordinated targeting of specific molecular functions. A second layer of PTM coordination exists in these complexes, mediated by PTM integration (PTMi) spots. PTMi spots represent very dense modification patterns in disordered protein regions and showed an equally high mutation rate as functional protein domains in cancer, inferring equivocal importance for cellular functioning. Systematic PTMi spot identification highlighted more than 300 candidate proteins for combinatorial PTM regulation. This study reveals two global PTM coordination mechanisms and emphasizes dataset integration as requisite in proteomic PTM studies to better predict modification impact on cellular signaling.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6OUa2epENUE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Since divergence ∼50 Ma ago from their terrestrial ancestors, cetaceans underwent a series of adaptations such as a ∼10–20 fold increase in myoglobin (Mb) concentration in skeletal muscle, critical for increasing oxygen storage capacity and prolonging dive time. Whereas the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-binding affinity of Mbs is not significantly different among mammals (with typical oxygenation constants of ∼0.8–1.2 µM&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), folding stabilities of cetacean Mbs are ∼2–4 kcal/mol higher than for terrestrial Mbs. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction, maximum likelihood and Bayesian tests to describe the evolution of cetacean Mbs, and experimentally calibrated computation of stability effects of mutations, we observe accelerated evolution in cetaceans and identify seven positively selected sites in Mb. Overall, these sites contribute to Mb stabilization with a conditional probability of 0.8. We observe a correlation between Mb folding stability and protein abundance, suggesting that a selection pressure for stability acts proportionally to higher expression. We also identify a major divergence event leading to the common ancestor of whales, during which major stabilization occurred. Most of the positively selected sites that occur later act against other destabilizing mutations to maintain stability across the clade, except for the shallow divers, where late stability relaxation occurs, probably due to the shorter aerobic dive limits of these species. The three main positively selected sites 66, 5, and 35 undergo changes that favor hydrophobic folding, structural integrity, and intra-helical hydrogen bonds.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wRsAcNaDO8o" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Flexibility in neuronal circuits has its roots in the dynamical richness of their neurons. Depending on their membrane properties single neurons can produce a plethora of activity regimes including silence, spiking and bursting. What is less appreciated is that these regimes can coexist with each other so that a transient stimulus can cause persistent change in the activity of a given neuron. Such multistability of the neuronal dynamics has been shown in a variety of neurons under different modulatory conditions. It can play either a functional role or present a substrate for dynamical diseases. We considered a database of an isolated leech heart interneuron model that can display silent, tonic spiking and bursting regimes. We analyzed only the cases of endogenous bursters producing functional half-center oscillators (HCOs). Using a one parameter (the leak conductance ()) bifurcation analysis, we extended the database to include silent regimes (stationary states) and systematically classified cases for the coexistence of silent and bursting regimes. We showed that different cases could exhibit two stable depolarized stationary states and two hyperpolarized stationary states in addition to various spiking and bursting regimes. We analyzed all cases of endogenous bursters and found that 18% of the cases were multistable, exhibiting coexistences of stationary states and bursting. Moreover, 91% of the cases exhibited multistability in some range of . We also explored HCOs built of multistable neuron cases with coexisting stationary states and a bursting regime. In 96% of cases analyzed, the HCOs resumed normal alternating bursting after one of the neurons was reset to a stationary state, proving themselves robust against this perturbation.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Hlw_2EWqU9c" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        “&lt;i&gt;It is hard to realize that the living world as we know it is just one among many possibilities&lt;/i&gt;” [1]. Evolving digital ecological networks are webs of interacting, self-replicating, and evolving computer programs (i.e., digital organisms) that experience the same major ecological interactions as biological organisms (e.g., competition, predation, parasitism, and mutualism). Despite being computational, these programs evolve quickly in an open-ended way, and starting from only one or two ancestral organisms, the formation of ecological networks can be observed in real-time by tracking interactions between the constantly evolving organism phenotypes. These phenotypes may be defined by combinations of logical computations (hereafter tasks) that digital organisms perform and by expressed behaviors that have evolved. The types and outcomes of interactions between phenotypes are determined by task overlap for logic-defined phenotypes and by responses to encounters in the case of behavioral phenotypes. Biologists use these evolving networks to study active and fundamental topics within evolutionary ecology (e.g., the extent to which the architecture of multispecies networks shape coevolutionary outcomes, and the processes involved).&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/R6Kp6mQhtBs" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        The decreasing cost of sequencing is leading to a growing repertoire of personal genomes. However, we are lagging behind in understanding the functional consequences of the millions of variants obtained from sequencing. Global system-wide effects of variants in coding genes are particularly poorly understood. It is known that while variants in some genes can lead to diseases, complete disruption of other genes, called ‘loss-of-function tolerant’, is possible with no obvious effect. Here, we build a systems-based classifier to quantitatively estimate the global perturbation caused by deleterious mutations in each gene. We first survey the degree to which gene centrality in various individual networks and a unified ‘Multinet’ correlates with the tolerance to loss-of-function mutations and evolutionary conservation. We find that functionally significant and highly conserved genes tend to be more central in physical protein-protein and regulatory networks. However, this is not the case for metabolic pathways, where the highly central genes have more duplicated copies and are more tolerant to loss-of-function mutations. Integration of three-dimensional protein structures reveals that the correlation with centrality in the protein-protein interaction network is also seen in terms of the number of interaction interfaces used. Finally, combining all the network and evolutionary properties allows us to build a classifier distinguishing functionally essential and loss-of-function tolerant genes with higher accuracy (AUC = 0.91) than any individual property. Application of the classifier to the whole genome shows its strong potential for interpretation of variants involved in Mendelian diseases and in complex disorders probed by genome-wide association studies.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1VVs9n7MdAQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        The salamander has the remarkable ability to regenerate its limb after amputation. Cells at the site of amputation form a blastema and then proliferate and differentiate to regrow the limb. To better understand this process, we performed deep RNA sequencing of the blastema over a time course in the axolotl, a species whose genome has not been sequenced. Using a novel comparative approach to analyzing RNA-seq data, we characterized the transcriptional dynamics of the regenerating axolotl limb with respect to the human gene set. This approach involved de novo assembly of axolotl transcripts, RNA-seq transcript quantification without a reference genome, and transformation of abundances from axolotl contigs to human genes. We found a prominent burst in oncogene expression during the first day and blastemal/limb bud genes peaking at 7 to 14 days. In addition, we found that limb patterning genes, SALL genes, and genes involved in angiogenesis, wound healing, defense/immunity, and bone development are enriched during blastema formation and development. Finally, we identified a category of genes with no prior literature support for limb regeneration that are candidates for further evaluation based on their expression pattern during the regenerative process.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tXniN0H1AvQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        A full understanding of gene regulation requires an understanding of the contributions that the various regulatory regions have on gene expression. Although it is well established that sequences downstream of the main promoter can affect expression, our understanding of the scale of this effect and how it is encoded in the DNA is limited. Here, to measure the effect of native &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; 3′ end sequences on expression, we constructed a library of 85 fluorescent reporter strains that differ only in their 3′ end region. Notably, despite being driven by the same strong promoter, our library spans a continuous twelve-fold range of expression values. These measurements correlate with endogenous mRNA levels, suggesting that the 3′ end contributes to constitutive differences in mRNA levels. We used deep sequencing to map the 3′UTR ends of our strains and show that determination of polyadenylation sites is intrinsic to the local 3′ end sequence. Polyadenylation mapping was followed by sequence analysis, we found that increased A/T content upstream of the main polyadenylation site correlates with higher expression, both in the library and genome-wide, suggesting that native genes differ by the encoded efficiency of 3′ end processing. Finally, we use single cells fluorescence measurements, in different promoter activation levels, to show that 3′ end sequences modulate protein expression dynamics differently than promoters, by predominantly affecting the size of protein production bursts as opposed to the frequency at which these bursts occur. Altogether, our results lead to a more complete understanding of gene regulation by demonstrating that 3′ end regions have a unique and sequence dependent effect on gene expression.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2UqKL14ioME" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Given the extraordinary ability of humans and animals to recognize communication signals over a background of noise, describing noise invariant neural responses is critical not only to pinpoint the brain regions that are mediating our robust perceptions but also to understand the neural computations that are performing these tasks and the underlying circuitry. Although invariant neural responses, such as rotation-invariant face cells, are well described in the visual system, high-level auditory neurons that can represent the same behaviorally relevant signal in a range of listening conditions have yet to be discovered. Here we found neurons in a secondary area of the avian auditory cortex that exhibit noise-invariant responses in the sense that they responded with similar spike patterns to song stimuli presented in silence and over a background of naturalistic noise. By characterizing the neurons' tuning in terms of their responses to modulations in the temporal and spectral envelope of the sound, we then show that noise invariance is partly achieved by selectively responding to long sounds with sharp spectral structure. Finally, to demonstrate that such computations could explain noise invariance, we designed a biologically inspired noise-filtering algorithm that can be used to separate song or speech from noise. This novel noise-filtering method performs as well as other state-of-the-art de-noising algorithms and could be used in clinical or consumer oriented applications. Our biologically inspired model also shows how high-level noise-invariant responses could be created from neural responses typically found in primary auditory cortex.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jaOXbAgQ4co" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Modelling the displacement of thousands of cells that move in a collective way is required for the simulation and the theoretical analysis of various biological processes. Here, we tackle this question in the controlled setting where the motion of Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells in a confluent epithelium is triggered by the unmasking of free surface. We develop a simple model in which cells are described as point particles with a dynamic based on the two premises that, first, cells move in a stochastic manner and, second, tend to adapt their motion to that of their neighbors. Detailed comparison to experimental data show that the model provides a quantitatively accurate description of cell motion in the epithelium bulk at early times. In addition, inclusion of model “leader” cells with modified characteristics, accounts for the digitated shape of the interface which develops over the subsequent hours, providing that leader cells invade free surface more easily than other cells and coordinate their motion with their followers. The previously-described progression of the epithelium border is reproduced by the model and quantitatively explained.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EOI-tZpyLZw" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Bacteria sense and respond to their environment through signaling cascades generally referred to as two-component signaling networks. These networks comprise histidine kinases and their cognate response regulators. Histidine kinases have a number of biochemical activities: ATP binding, autophosphorylation, the ability to act as a phosphodonor for their response regulators, and in many cases the ability to catalyze the hydrolytic dephosphorylation of their response regulator. Here, we explore the functional role of “split kinases” where the ATP binding and phosphotransfer activities of a conventional histidine kinase are split onto two distinct proteins that form a complex. We find that this unusual configuration can enable ultrasensitivity and bistability in the signal-response relationship of the resulting system. These dynamics are displayed under a wide parameter range but only when specific biochemical requirements are met. We experimentally show that one of these requirements, namely segregation of the phosphatase activity predominantly onto the free form of one of the proteins making up the split kinase, is met in Rhodobacter sphaeroides. These findings indicate split kinases as a bacterial alternative for enabling ultrasensitivity and bistability in signaling networks. Genomic analyses reveal that up 1.7% of all identified histidine kinases have the potential to be split and bifunctional.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Gy0Ehdjl2tw" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Pollinating bees develop foraging circuits (traplines) to visit multiple flowers in a manner that minimizes overall travel distance, a task analogous to the travelling salesman problem. We report on an in-depth exploration of an iterative improvement heuristic model of bumblebee traplining previously found to accurately replicate the establishment of stable routes by bees between flowers distributed over several hectares. The critical test for a model is its predictive power for empirical data for which the model has not been specifically developed, and here the model is shown to be consistent with observations from different research groups made at several spatial scales and using multiple configurations of flowers. We refine the model to account for the spatial search strategy of bees exploring their environment, and test several previously unexplored predictions. We find that the model predicts accurately 1) the increasing propensity of bees to optimize their foraging routes with increasing spatial scale; 2) that bees cannot establish stable optimal traplines for all spatial configurations of rewarding flowers; 3) the observed trade-off between travel distance and prioritization of high-reward sites (with a slight modification of the model); 4) the temporal pattern with which bees acquire approximate solutions to travelling salesman-like problems over several dozen foraging bouts; 5) the instability of visitation schedules in some spatial configurations of flowers; 6) the observation that in some flower arrays, bees' visitation schedules are highly individually different; 7) the searching behaviour that leads to efficient location of flowers and routes between them. Our model constitutes a robust theoretical platform to generate novel hypotheses and refine our understanding about how small-brained insects develop a representation of space and use it to navigate in complex and dynamic environments.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5av6jfOjI_E" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Complex traits such as obesity are manifestations of intricate interactions of multiple genetic factors. However, such relationships are difficult to identify. Thanks to the recent advance in high-throughput technology, a large amount of data has been collected for various complex traits, including obesity. These data often measure different biological aspects of the traits of interest, including genotypic variations at the DNA level and gene expression alterations at the RNA level. Integration of such heterogeneous data provides promising opportunities to understand the genetic components and possibly genetic architecture of complex traits. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based method, &lt;i&gt;module-guided Random Forest&lt;/i&gt;s (mgRF), to integrate genotypic and gene expression data to investigate genetic factors and molecular mechanism underlying complex traits. mgRF is an augmented Random Forests method enhanced by a network analysis for identifying multiple correlated variables of different types. We applied mgRF to genetic markers and gene expression data from a cohort of F2 female mouse intercross. mgRF outperformed several existing methods in our extensive comparison. Our new approach has an improved performance when combining both genotypic and gene expression data compared to using either one of the two types of data alone. The resulting predictive variables identified by mgRF provide information of perturbed pathways that are related to body weight. More importantly, the results uncovered intricate interactions among genetic markers and genes that have been overlooked if only one type of data was examined. Our results shed light on genetic mechanisms of obesity and our approach provides a promising complementary framework to the “genetics of gene expression” analysis for integrating genotypic and gene expression information for analyzing complex traits.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Hz5MH1--0kc" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Comparing the gene-expression profiles of sick and healthy individuals can help in understanding disease. Such differential expression analysis is a well-established way to find gene sets whose expression is altered in the disease. Recent approaches to gene-expression analysis go a step further and seek differential co-expression patterns, wherein the level of co-expression of a set of genes differs markedly between disease and control samples. Such patterns can arise from a disease-related change in the regulatory mechanism governing that set of genes, and pinpoint dysfunctional regulatory networks.
        Here we present DICER, a new method for detecting differentially co-expressed gene sets using a novel probabilistic score for differential correlation. DICER goes beyond standard differential co-expression and detects pairs of modules showing differential co-expression. The expression profiles of genes within each module of the pair are correlated across all samples. The correlation between the two modules, however, differs markedly between the disease and normal samples.
        We show that DICER outperforms the state of the art in terms of significance and interpretability of the detected gene sets. Moreover, the gene sets discovered by DICER manifest regulation by disease-specific microRNA families. In a case study on Alzheimer's disease, DICER dissected biological processes and protein complexes into functional subunits that are differentially co-expressed, thereby revealing inner structures in disease regulatory networks.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C8kyhYCJLYw" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Despite intense interest and considerable effort via high-throughput screening, there are few examples of small molecules that directly inhibit protein-protein interactions. This suggests that many protein interaction surfaces may not be intrinsically “druggable” by small molecules, and elevates in importance the few successful examples as model systems for improving our fundamental understanding of druggability. Here we describe an approach for exploring protein fluctuations enriched in conformations containing surface pockets suitable for small molecule binding. Starting from a set of seven unbound protein structures, we find that the presence of low-energy pocket-containing conformations is indeed a signature of druggable protein interaction sites and that analogous surface pockets are not formed elsewhere on the protein. We further find that ensembles of conformations generated with this biased approach structurally resemble known inhibitor-bound structures more closely than equivalent ensembles of unbiased conformations. Collectively these results suggest that “druggability” is a property encoded on a protein surface through its propensity to form pockets, and inspire a model in which the crude features of the predisposed pocket(s) restrict the range of complementary ligands; additional smaller conformational changes then respond to details of a particular ligand. We anticipate that the insights described here will prove useful in selecting protein targets for therapeutic intervention.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XhEaZ66Rdqg" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Fusion peptides from influenza hemagglutinin act on membranes to promote membrane fusion, but the mechanism by which they do so remains unknown. Recent theoretical work has suggested that contact of protruding lipid tails may be an important feature of the transition state for membrane fusion. If this is so, then influenza fusion peptides would be expected to promote tail protrusion in proportion to the ability of the corresponding full-length hemagglutinin to drive lipid mixing in fusion assays. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of influenza fusion peptides in lipid bilayers, comparing the X-31 influenza strain against a series of N-terminal mutants. As hypothesized, the probability of lipid tail protrusion correlates well with the lipid mixing rate induced by each mutant. This supports the conclusion that tail protrusion is important to the transition state for fusion. Furthermore, it suggests that tail protrusion can be used to examine how fusion peptides might interact with membranes to promote fusion. Previous models for native influenza fusion peptide structure in membranes include a kinked helix, a straight helix, and a helical hairpin. Our simulations visit each of these conformations. Thus, the free energy differences between each are likely low enough that specifics of the membrane environment and peptide construct may be sufficient to modulate the equilibrium between them. However, the kinked helix promotes lipid tail protrusion in our simulations much more strongly than the other two structures. We therefore predict that the kinked helix is the most fusogenic of these three conformations.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JwOZZPu6fIY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Theoretical models of infection spread on networks predict that targeting vaccination at individuals with a very large number of contacts (superspreaders) can reduce infection incidence by a significant margin. These models generally assume that superspreaders will always agree to be vaccinated. Hence, they cannot capture unintended consequences such as policy resistance, where the behavioral response induced by a new vaccine policy tends to reduce the expected benefits of the policy. Here, we couple a model of influenza transmission on an empirically-based contact network with a psychologically structured model of influenza vaccinating behavior, where individual vaccinating decisions depend on social learning and past experiences of perceived infections, vaccine complications and vaccine failures. We find that policy resistance almost completely undermines the effectiveness of superspreader strategies: the most commonly explored approaches that target a randomly chosen neighbor of an individual, or that preferentially choose neighbors with many contacts, provide at best a  relative improvement over their non-targeted counterpart as compared to  when behavioral feedbacks are ignored. Increased vaccine coverage in super spreaders is offset by decreased coverage in non-superspreaders, and superspreaders also have a higher rate of perceived vaccine failures on account of being infected more often. Including incentives for vaccination provides modest improvements in outcomes. We conclude that the design of influenza vaccine strategies involving widespread incentive use and/or targeting of superspreaders should account for policy resistance, and mitigate it whenever possible.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lUxACSgsBRY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Recent experimental measurements have demonstrated that spontaneous neural activity in the absence of explicit external stimuli has remarkable spatiotemporal structure. This spontaneous activity has also been shown to play a key role in the response to external stimuli. To better understand this role, we proposed a viewpoint, “memories-as-bifurcations,” that differs from the traditional “memories-as-attractors” viewpoint. Memory recall from the memories-as-bifurcations viewpoint occurs when the spontaneous neural activity is changed to an appropriate output activity upon application of an input, known as a bifurcation in dynamical systems theory, wherein the input modifies the flow structure of the neural dynamics. Learning, then, is a process that helps create neural dynamical systems such that a target output pattern is generated as an attractor upon a given input. Based on this novel viewpoint, we introduce in this paper an associative memory model with a sequential learning process. Using a simple Hebbian-type learning, the model is able to memorize a large number of input/output mappings. The neural dynamics shaped through the learning exhibit different bifurcations to make the requested targets stable upon an increase in the input, and the neural activity in the absence of input shows chaotic dynamics with occasional approaches to the memorized target patterns. These results suggest that these dynamics facilitate the bifurcations to each target attractor upon application of the corresponding input, which thus increases the capacity for learning. This theoretical finding about the behavior of the spontaneous neural activity is consistent with recent experimental observations in which the neural activity without stimuli wanders among patterns evoked by previously applied signals. In addition, the neural networks shaped by learning properly reflect the correlations of input and target-output patterns in a similar manner to those designed in our previous study.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uyIVKtJc3oc" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        The formation of the complex network architecture of neural systems is subject to multiple structural and functional constraints. Two obvious but apparently contradictory constraints are low wiring cost and high processing efficiency, characterized by short overall wiring length and a small average number of processing steps, respectively. Growing evidence shows that neural networks are results from a trade-off between physical cost and functional value of the topology. However, the relationship between these competing constraints and complex topology is not well understood quantitatively. We explored this relationship systematically by reconstructing two known neural networks, Macaque cortical connectivity and &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; neuronal connections, from combinatory optimization of wiring cost and processing efficiency constraints, using a control parameter , and comparing the reconstructed networks to the real networks. We found that in both neural systems, the reconstructed networks derived from the two constraints can reveal some important relations between the spatial layout of nodes and the topological connectivity, and match several properties of the real networks. The reconstructed and real networks had a similar modular organization in a broad range of , resulting from spatial clustering of network nodes. Hubs emerged due to the competition of the two constraints, and their positions were close to, and partly coincided, with the real hubs in a range of  values. The degree of nodes was correlated with the density of nodes in their spatial neighborhood in both reconstructed and real networks. Generally, the rebuilt network matched a significant portion of real links, especially short-distant ones. These findings provide clear evidence to support the hypothesis of trade-off between multiple constraints on brain networks. The two constraints of wiring cost and processing efficiency, however, cannot explain all salient features in the real networks. The discrepancy suggests that there are further relevant factors that are not yet captured here.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/D5MHpaM-cT4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        The release of Ca from intracellular stores is key to cardiac muscle function; however, the molecular control of intracellular Ca release remains unclear. Depletion of the intracellular Ca store (sarcoplasmic reticulum, SR) may play an important role, but the ability to measure local SR Ca with fluorescent Ca indicators is limited by the microscope optical resolution and properties of the indicator. This leads to an uncertain degree of spatio-temporal blurring, which is not easily corrected (by deconvolution methods) due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the recorded signals. In this study, a 3D computer model was constructed to calculate local Ca fluxes and consequent dye signals, which were then blurred by a measured microscope point spread function. Parameter fitting was employed to adjust a release basis function until the model output fitted recorded (2D) Ca spark data. This ‘forward method’ allowed us to obtain estimates of the time-course of Ca release flux and depletion within the sub-microscopic local SR associated with a number of Ca sparks. While variability in focal position relative to Ca spark sites causes more out-of-focus events to have smaller calculated fluxes (and less SR depletion), the average SR depletion was to 20±10% (s.d.) of the resting level. This focus problem implies that the actual SR depletion is likely to be larger and the five largest depletions analyzed were to 8±6% of the resting level. This profound depletion limits SR release flux during a Ca spark, which peaked at 8±3 pA and declined with a half time of 7±2 ms. By comparison, RyR open probability declined more slowly, suggesting release termination is dominated by neither SR Ca depletion nor intrinsic RyR gating, but results from an interaction of these processes.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/58Q62Cemro8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        An integrative cell migration model incorporating focal adhesion (FA) dynamics, cytoskeleton and nucleus remodeling, actin motor activity, and lamellipodia protrusion is developed for predicting cell spreading and migration behaviors. This work is motivated by two experimental works: (1) cell migration on 2-D substrates under various fibronectin concentrations and (2) cell spreading on 2-D micropatterned geometries. These works suggest (1) cell migration speed takes a maximum at a particular ligand density (∼1140 molecules/µm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and (2) that strong traction forces at the corners of the patterns may exist due to combined effects exerted by actin stress fibers (SFs). The integrative model of this paper successfully reproduced these experimental results and indicates the mechanism of cell migration and spreading. In this paper, the mechanical structure of the cell is modeled as having two elastic membranes: an outer cell membrane and an inner nuclear membrane. The two elastic membranes are connected by SFs, which are extended from focal adhesions on the cortical surface to the nuclear membrane. In addition, the model also includes ventral SFs bridging two focal adhesions on the cell surface. The cell deforms and gains traction as transmembrane integrins distributed over the outer cell membrane bond to ligands on the ECM surface, activate SFs, and form focal adhesions. The relationship between the cell migration speed and fibronectin concentration agrees with existing experimental data for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell migrations on fibronectin coated surfaces. In addition, the integrated model is validated by showing persistent high stress concentrations at sharp geometrically patterned edges. This model will be used as a predictive model to assist in design and data processing of upcoming microfluidic cell migration assays.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oMxapNvSzuM" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Change detection is a classic paradigm that has been used for decades to argue that working memory can hold no more than a fixed number of items (“item-limit models”). Recent findings force us to consider the alternative view that working memory is limited by the precision in stimulus encoding, with mean precision decreasing with increasing set size (“continuous-resource models”). Most previous studies that used the change detection paradigm have ignored effects of limited encoding precision by using highly discriminable stimuli and only large changes. We conducted two change detection experiments (orientation and color) in which change magnitudes were drawn from a wide range, including small changes. In a rigorous comparison of five models, we found no evidence of an item limit. Instead, human change detection performance was best explained by a continuous-resource model in which encoding precision is variable across items and trials even at a given set size. This model accounts for comparison errors in a principled, probabilistic manner. Our findings sharply challenge the theoretical basis for most neural studies of working memory capacity.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tS2ekLKnyhc" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Stimulus-induced perturbations from the steady state are a hallmark of signal transduction. In some signaling modules, the steady state is characterized by rapid synthesis and degradation of signaling proteins. Conspicuous among these are the p53 tumor suppressor, its negative regulator Mdm2, and the negative feedback regulator of NFκB, IκBα. We investigated the physiological importance of this turnover, or flux, using a computational method that allows flux to be systematically altered independently of the steady state protein abundances. Applying our method to a prototypical signaling module, we show that flux can precisely control the dynamic response to perturbation. Next, we applied our method to experimentally validated models of p53 and NFκB signaling. We find that high p53 flux is required for oscillations in response to a saturating dose of ionizing radiation (IR). In contrast, high flux of Mdm2 is not required for oscillations but preserves p53 sensitivity to sub-saturating doses of IR. In the NFκB system, degradation of NFκB-bound IκB by the IκB kinase (IKK) is required for activation in response to TNF, while high IKK-independent degradation prevents spurious activation in response to metabolic stress or low doses of TNF. Our work identifies flux pairs with opposing functional effects as a signaling motif that controls the stimulus-sensitivity of the p53 and NFκB stress-response pathways, and may constitute a general design principle in signaling pathways.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a6QE36qri28" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Spermine synthase (SMS) is an enzyme which function is to convert spermidine into spermine. It was shown that gene defects resulting in amino acid changes of the wild type SMS cause Snyder-Robinson syndrome, which is a mild-to-moderate mental disability associated with osteoporosis, facial asymmetry, thin habitus, hypotonia, and a nonspecific movement disorder. These disease-causing missense mutations were demonstrated, both in silico and in vitro, to affect the wild type function of SMS by either destabilizing the SMS dimer/monomer or directly affecting the hydrogen bond network of the active site of SMS. In contrast to these studies, here we report an artificial engineering of a more efficient SMS variant by transferring sequence information from another organism. It is confirmed experimentally that the variant, bearing four amino acid substitutions, is catalytically more active than the wild type. The increased functionality is attributed to enhanced monomer stability, lowering the pKa of proton donor catalytic residue, optimized spatial distribution of the electrostatic potential around the SMS with respect to substrates, and increase of the frequency of mechanical vibration of the clefts presumed to be the gates toward the active sites. The study demonstrates that wild type SMS is not particularly evolutionarily optimized with respect to the reaction spermidine → spermine. Having in mind that currently there are no variations (non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism, nsSNP) detected in healthy individuals, it can be speculated that the human SMS function is precisely tuned toward its wild type and any deviation is unwanted and disease-causing.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hGaXfVPJzz0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Integrating computer simulation with conventional wet-lab research has proven to have much potential in furthering the understanding of biological systems. Success requires the relationship between simulation and the real-world system to be established: substantial aspects of the biological system are typically unknown, and the abstract nature of simulation can complicate interpretation of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; results in terms of the biology. Here we present &lt;i&gt;spartan&lt;/i&gt; (Simulation Parameter Analysis R Toolkit ApplicatioN), a package of statistical techniques specifically designed to help researchers understand this relationship and provide novel biological insight. The tools comprising &lt;i&gt;spartan&lt;/i&gt; help identify which simulation results can be attributed to the dynamics of the modelled biological system, rather than artefacts of biological uncertainty or parametrisation, or simulation stochasticity. Statistical analyses reveal the influence that pathways and components have on simulation behaviour, offering valuable biological insight into aspects of the system under study. We demonstrate the power of &lt;i&gt;spartan&lt;/i&gt; in providing critical insight into aspects of lymphoid tissue development in the small intestine through simulation. &lt;i&gt;Spartan&lt;/i&gt; is released under a GPLv2 license, implemented within the open source R statistical environment, and freely available from both the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/spartan. The techniques within the package can be applied to traditional ordinary or partial differential equation simulations as well as agent-based implementations. Manuals, comprehensive tutorials, and example simulation data upon which &lt;i&gt;spartan&lt;/i&gt; can be applied are available from the website.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FBdj641Ild4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        The spontaneous emergence of pattern formation is ubiquitous in nature, often arising as a collective phenomenon from interactions among a large number of individual constituents or sub-systems. Understanding, and controlling, collective behavior is dependent on determining the low-level dynamical principles from which spatial and temporal patterns emerge; a key question is whether different group-level patterns result from all components of a system responding to the same external factor, individual components changing behavior but in a distributed self-organized way, or whether multiple collective states co-exist for the same individual behaviors. Using schooling fish (golden shiners, in groups of 30 to 300 fish) as a model system, we demonstrate that collective motion can be effectively mapped onto a set of order parameters describing the macroscopic group structure, revealing the existence of at least three dynamically-stable collective states; swarm, milling and polarized groups. Swarms are characterized by slow individual motion and a relatively dense, disordered structure. Increasing swim speed is associated with a transition to one of two locally-ordered states, milling or highly-mobile polarized groups. The stability of the discrete collective behaviors exhibited by a group depends on the number of group members. Transitions between states are influenced by both external (boundary-driven) and internal (changing motion of group members) factors. Whereas transitions between locally-disordered and locally-ordered group states are speed dependent, analysis of local and global properties of groups suggests that, congruent with theory, milling and polarized states co-exist in a bistable regime with transitions largely driven by perturbations. Our study allows us to relate theoretical and empirical understanding of animal group behavior and emphasizes dynamic changes in the structure of such groups.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X0yJcN8LrN8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how ion channels and transporters distinguish between similar ions, a process crucial for maintaining proper cell function. Of these, three can be broadly classed as mechanisms involving specific positional constraints on the ion coordinating ligands which arise through: a “rigid cavity”, a ‘strained cavity’ and ‘reduced ligand fluctuations’. Each operates in subtly different ways yet can produce markedly different influences on ion selectivity. Here we expand upon preliminary investigations into the reduced ligand fluctuation mechanism of ion selectivity by simulating how a series of model systems respond to a decrease in ligand thermal fluctuations while simultaneously maintaining optimal ion-ligand binding distances. Simple abstract-ligand models, as well as simple models based upon the ion binding sites in two amino acid transporters, show that limiting ligand fluctuations can create ion selectivity between Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; even when there is no strain associated with the molecular framework accommodating the different ions. Reducing the fluctuations in the position of the coordinating ligands contributes to selectivity toward the smaller of two ions as a consequence of entropic differences.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FaDZErVzhHA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        Antibodies binding to the surface of virions can lead to virus neutralisation. Different theories have been proposed to determine the number of antibodies that must bind to a virion for neutralisation. Early models are based on chemical binding kinetics. Applying these models lead to very low estimates of the number of antibodies needed for neutralisation. In contrast, according to the more conceptual approach of stoichiometries in virology a much higher number of antibodies is required for virus neutralisation by antibodies. Here, we combine chemical binding kinetics with (virological) stoichiometries to better explain virus neutralisation by antibody binding. This framework is in agreement with published data on the neutralisation of the human immunodeficiency virus. Knowing antibody reaction constants, our model allows us to estimate stoichiometrical parameters from kinetic neutralisation curves. In addition, we can identify important parameters that will make further analysis of kinetic neutralisation curves more valuable in the context of estimating stoichiometries. Our model gives a more subtle explanation of kinetic neutralisation curves in terms of single-hit and multi-hit kinetics.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XGc5dEzxFDA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        As animals move through the world in search of resources, they change course in reaction to both external sensory cues and internally-generated programs. Elucidating the functional logic of complex search algorithms is challenging because the observable actions of the animal cannot be unambiguously assigned to externally- or internally-triggered events. We present a technique that addresses this challenge by assessing quantitatively the contribution of external stimuli and internal processes. We apply this technique to the analysis of rapid turns (“saccades”) of freely flying &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. We show that a single scalar feature computed from the visual stimulus experienced by the animal is sufficient to explain a majority (93%) of the turning decisions. We automatically estimate this scalar value from the observable trajectory, without any assumption regarding the sensory processing. A posteriori, we show that the estimated feature field is consistent with previous results measured in other experimental conditions. The remaining turning decisions, not explained by this feature of the visual input, may be attributed to a combination of deterministic processes based on unobservable internal states and purely stochastic behavior. We cannot distinguish these contributions using external observations alone, but we are able to provide a quantitative bound of their relative importance with respect to stimulus-triggered decisions. Our results suggest that comparatively few saccades in free-flying conditions are a result of an intrinsic spontaneous process, contrary to previous suggestions. We discuss how this technique could be generalized for use in other systems and employed as a tool for classifying effects into sensory, decision, and motor categories when used to analyze data from genetic behavioral screens.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NOyHCTynEug" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

        The HAMP domain is a linker region in prokaryotic sensor proteins and relays input signals to the transmitter domain and vice versa. Functional as a dimer, the structure of HAMP shows a parallel coiled-coil motif comprising four helices. To date, it is unclear how HAMP can relay signals from one domain to another, although several models exist. In this work, we use molecular simulation to test the hypothesis that HAMP adopts different conformations, one of which represents an active, signal-relaying configuration, and another an inactive, resting state. We first performed molecular dynamics simulation on the prototype HAMP domain Af1503 from &lt;i&gt;Archaeoglobus fulgidus&lt;/i&gt;. We explored its conformational space by taking the structure of the A291F mutant disabling HAMP activity as a starting point. These simulations revealed additional conformational states that differ in the tilt angles between the helices as well as the relative piston shifts of the helices relative to each other. By enhancing the sampling in a metadynamics set up, we investigated three mechanistic models for HAMP signal transduction. Our results indicate that HAMP can access additional conformational states characterized by piston motion. Furthermore, the piston motion of the N-terminal helix of one monomer is directly correlated with the opposite piston motion of the C-terminal helix of the other monomer. The change in piston motion is accompanied by a change in tilt angle between the monomers, thus revealing that HAMP exhibits a collective motion, &lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt; a combination of changes in tilt angles and a piston-like displacement. Our results provide insights into the conformational changes that underlie the signaling mechanism involving HAMP.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VjWn2GNImcs" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content>

<title>Cross recurrence quantification analysis of precision grip following peripheral median nerve block</title>
<description>Background:
Precision grip by the thumb and index finger is vulnerable to sensorimotor deficits. Traditional biomechanical parameters offer limited insight into the dynamical coordination between digits during precision grip. In this study, the thumb and index finger were viewed as &quot;coupled systems&quot;, and a cross recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA) was used to examine the changes of interdigit dynamics and synchronization caused by peripheral median nerve block.
Methods:
Seven subjects performed a precision grip by holding an instrumented handle before and after median nerve block at the wrist. The forces and the torques at each digit-handle interface were recorded with two six-component transducers. For CRQA, the percentage of recurrence rate (%RR), percentage of determinism (%DET), longest diagonal line (Lmax) and percentage of laminarity (%LAM) were computed for the force, torque and center of pressure (COP) signals. Phase synchronization of the thumb and index finger was examined based on the tau-recurrence rate. Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for statistical comparisons. The twin-surrogate hypothesis test was used to examine phase synchronization.
Results:
Nerve block led to significant increases (p &lt; 0.05) for%DET, Lmax and%LAM in all components of force, torque, and COP. Only the normal force met the conditions of phase synchronization for all successfully completed pre- and post-block grasping trials. The probability of synchronization with larger time lags (tau &gt; 0.1 s) increased after nerve block. The percentage of trials that the thumb led the index finger increased from 52% (pre-block) to 86% (post-block).
Conclusions:
Nerve block caused more deterministic structures in force, torque and center of pressure when the thumb interacted with the index finger. A compensatory mechanism may be responsible for this change. Phase synchronization between the opposite normal forces exerted by the thumb and index finger would be an essential dynamical principle for a precision grip. The nerve block resulted in an increased interdigit phase delay and increased probability that the thumb leads the index finger. The CRQA provides an effective tool to examine interdigit coordination during precision grip and has the potential for clinical evaluation of hand dysfunction.</description>

<title>Planning and adjustments for the control of reach extent in a virtual environment</title>
<description>Background:
Skilled performance of reach actions includes both anticipatory planning and compensatory adjustments made while moving. The execution of reach actions in a virtual environment (VE) demonstrates similar characteristics to reaches performed in the real-world, however, it is unclear whether the VE itself significantly impacts movement planning or compensatory adjustments. The purpose of this study was to directly compare the use of planning and adjustments to control extent for unconstrained reach actions performed in an immersive VE to those performed in an analogous real-world environment (RWE).
Methods:
Five non-disabled adults (29 +/- 5 years) reached with the dominant, right arm to six targets presented in two directions (+45[degree sign], -45[degree sign]) and three distances (8, 16, 24 cm) in a VE and an analogous RWE. Position data were sampled at 120 Hz from an electromagnetic marker on the index finger and differentiated to determine velocity and acceleration. The control of reach extent was compared between the two environments (paired t-test) as to the use of planning (correlation of peak acceleration with movement distance), compensatory adjustments prior to peak velocity (correlation of time to peak velocity with movement distance), and compensatory adjustments after peak velocity (variance in movement distance accounted for by deterministic statistical model).
Results:
Reach movements were relatively fast (&lt;400 msec) and scaled to target distance in both the VE and RWE. Overall, the control of reach extent was similar in all respects between the two environments. In both environments, a hybrid control pattern was observed. That is, individuals utilized a combined strategy that relied on both planning and compensatory adjustments to capture the target. Adjustments to the reach were evident prior to peak velocity through changes in acceleration duration as well as after peak velocity based on target information. The two factor deterministic statistical model (peak velocity, target distance) explained &gt;92% of the variance in movement distance across participants and environments.
Conclusions:
The VE did not impact movement planning or subsequent compensatory adjustments for the control of reach extent when directly compared to an analogous RWE. An immersive VE is a valid environment for the study of unconstrained reach actions.</description>

<title>Postural control as a function of time-of-day: influence of a prior strenuous running exercise or demanding sustained-attention task</title>
<description>Background:
The current experiment investigated the impact of two potential confounding variables on the postural balance in young participants: the induced-experimental activity prior to the static postural measurements and the well-documented time-of-day effects. We mainly hypothesized that an exhaustive exercise and a high attention-demanding task should result in alterations of postural control.
Methods:
Ten participants performed three experimental sessions (differentiated by the activity &#8211; none, cognitive or physical &#8211; prior of the assessment of postural stability), separated by one day at least. Each session included postural balance assessments around 8 a.m., 12.00 p.m. and 5 p.m. &#177; 30 min. The physical and cognitive activities were performed only before the 12 o&#8217;clock assessment. The postural tests consisted of four conditions of quiet stance: stance on a firm surface with eyes open; stance on a firm surface with eyes closed; stance on a foam surface with eyes open and stance on a foam surface with eyes closed. Postural performance was assessed by various center of pressure (COP) parameters.
Results:
Overall, the COP findings indicated activity-related postural impairment, with an increase in body sway in the most difficult conditions (with foam surface), especially when postural measurements are recorded just after the running exercise (physical session) or the psychomotor vigilance test (cognitive session).
Conclusions:
Even if no specific influence of time-of-day on static postural control is demonstrated, our results clearly suggest that the activities prior to balance tests could be a potential confounding variable to be taken into account and controlled when assessing clinical postural balance.</description>

<title>Optimization of selective stimulation parameters for multi-contact electrodes</title>
<description>Background:
Multi-contact stimulating electrodes are gaining acceptance as a means for interfacing with the peripheral nervous system. These electrodes can potentially activate many independent populations of motor units within a single peripheral nerve, but quantifying their recruitment properties and the overlap in stimulation between contacts is difficult and time consuming. Further, current methods for quantifying overlap between contacts are ambiguous and can lead to suboptimal selective stimulation parameters. This study describes a novel method for optimizing stimulation parameters for multi-contact peripheral stimulating electrodes to produce strong, selective muscle contractions. The method is tested with four-contact spiral nerve-cuff electrodes implanted on bilateral femoral nerves of two individuals with spinal cord injury, but it is designed to be extendable to other electrode technologies with higher densities of contacts.
Methods:
To optimize selective stimulation parameters for multi-contact electrodes, first, recruitment and overlap are characterized for all contacts within an electrode. Recruitment is measured with the twitch response to single stimulus pulses, and overlap between pairs of contacts is quantified by the deviation in their combined response from linear addition of individual responses. Simple mathematical models are fit to recruitment and overlap data, and a cost function is defined to maximize recruitment and minimize overlap between all contacts.
Results:
Results are presented for four-contact nerve-cuff electrodes stimulating bilateral femoral nerves of two human subjects with spinal cord injury. Knee extension moments between 11.6 and 43.2 Nm were achieved with selective stimulation through multiple contacts of each nerve-cuff with less than 10% overlap between pairs of contacts. The overlap in stimulation measured in response to selective stimulation parameters was stable at multiple repeated time points after implantation.
Conclusions:
These results suggest that the method described here can provide an automated means of determining stimulus parameters to achieve strong muscle contractions via selective stimulation through multi-contact peripheral nerve electrodes.</description>

<title>Modulation of event-related desynchronization in robot-assisted hand performance: brain oscillatory changes in active, passive and imagined movements</title>
<description>Background:
Robot-assisted therapy in patients with neurological disease is an attempt to improve function in a moderate to severe hemiparetic arm. A better understanding of cortical modifications after robot-assisted training could aid in refining rehabilitation therapy protocols for stroke patients. Modifications of cortical activity in healthy subjects were evaluated during voluntary active movement, passive robot-assisted motor movement, and motor imagery tasks performed under unimanual and bimanual protocols.
Methods:
Twenty-one channel electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded with a video EEG system in 8 subjects. The subjects performed robot-assisted tasks using the Bi-Manu Track robot-assisted arm trainer. The motor paradigm was executed during one-day experimental sessions under eleven unimanual and bimanual protocols of active, passive and imaged movements. The event-related-synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) approach to the EEG data was applied to investigate where movement-related decreases in alpha and beta power were localized.
Results:
Voluntary active unilateral hand movement was observed to significantly activate the contralateral side; however, bilateral activation was noted in all subjects on both the unilateral and bilateral active tasks, as well as desynchronization of alpha and beta brain oscillations during the passive robot-assisted motor tasks. During active-passive movement when the right hand drove the left one, there was predominant activation in the contralateral side. Conversely, when the left hand drove the right one, activation was bilateral, especially in the alpha range. Finally, significant contralateral EEG desynchronization was observed during the unilateral task and bilateral ERD during the bimanual task.
Conclusions:
This study suggests new perspectives for the assessment of patients with neurological disease. The findings may be relevant for defining a baseline for future studies investigating the neural correlates of behavioral changes after robot-assisted training in stroke patients.</description>

<title>Identification of the contribution of the ankle and hip joints to multi-segmental balance control</title>
<description>Background:
Human stance involves multiple segments, including the legs and trunk, and requires coordinated actions of both. A novel method was developed that reliably estimates the contribution of the left and right leg (i.e., the ankle and hip joints) to the balance control of individual subjects.
Methods:
The method was evaluated using simulations of a double-inverted pendulum model and the applicability was demonstrated with an experiment with seven healthy and one Parkinsonian participant. Model simulations indicated that two perturbations are required to reliably estimate the dynamics of a double-inverted pendulum balance control system. In the experiment, two multisine perturbation signals were applied simultaneously. The balance control system dynamic behaviour of the participants was estimated by Frequency Response Functions (FRFs), which relate ankle and hip joint angles to joint torques, using a multivariate closed-loop system identification technique.
Results:
In the model simulations, the FRFs were reliably estimated, also in the presence of realistic levels of noise. In the experiment, the participants responded consistently to the perturbations, indicated by low noise-to-signal ratios of the ankle angle (0.24), hip angle (0.28), ankle torque (0.07), and hip torque (0.33). The developed method could detect that the Parkinson patient controlled his balance asymmetrically, that is, the right ankle and hip joints produced more corrective torque.
Conclusion:
The method allows for a reliable estimate of the multisegmental feedback mechanism that stabilizes stance, of individual participants and of separate legs.</description>

<title>Effect on signal-to-noise ratio of splitting the continuous contacts of cuff electrodes into smaller recording areas</title>
<description>Background:
Cuff electrodes have been widely used chronically in different clinical applications. This neural interface has been dominantly used for nerve stimulation while interfering noise is the major issue when employed for recording purposes. Advancements have been made in rejecting extra-neural interference by using continuous ring contacts in tripolar topologies. Ring contacts provide an average of the neural activity, and thus reduce the information retrieved. Splitting these contacts into smaller recording areas could potentially increase the information content. In this study, we investigate the impact of such discretization on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). The effect of contacts positioning and an additional short circuited pair of electrodes were also addressed.
Methods:
Different recording configurations using ring, dot, and a mixed of both contacts were studied in vitro in a frog model. An interfering signal was induced in the medium to simulate myoelectric noise. The experimental setup was design in such a way that the only difference between recordings was the configuration used. The inter-session experimental differences were taking care of by a common configuration that allowed normalization between electrode designs.
Results:
It was found that splitting all contacts into small recording areas had negative effects on noise rejection. However, if this is only applied to the central contact creating a mixed tripole configuration, a considerable and statistically significant improvement was observed. Moreover, the signal to noise ratio was equal or larger than what can be achieved with the best known configuration, namely the short circuited tripole. This suggests that for recording purposes, any tripole topology would benefit from splitting the central contact into one or more discrete contacts.
Conclusions:
Our results showed that a mixed tripole configuration performs better than the configuration including only ring contacts. Therefore, splitting the central ring contact of a cuff electrode into a number of dot contacts not only provides additional information but also an improved SNR. In addition, the effect of an additional pair of short circuited electrodes and the &quot;end effect&quot; observed with the presented method are in line with previous findings by other authors.</description>

<title>The effects of actuator selection on non-volitional postural responses to torso-based vibrotactile stimulation</title>
<description>Background:
Torso-based vibrotactile feedback may significantly reduce postural sway in balance-compromised adults during quiet standing or in response to perturbations. However, natural non-volitional postural responses to vibrotactile stimulation applied to the torso remain unknown.
Methods:
The primary goal of this study was to determine, for two types of actuators (tactors) and in the absence of instruction, whether vibrotactile stimulation induces a directional postural shift as a function of stimulation location. Eleven healthy young adults (20 -- 29 years old) were asked to maintain an upright erect posture with feet hip-width apart and eyes closed. Two types of tactors, Tactaid and C2, which differ in design and stimulation strength, were placed on the skin over the right and left external oblique, internal oblique, and erector spinae muscles in a horizontal plane corresponding approximately to the L4/L5 level. Each tactor of the same type was activated twice randomly for each individual location and twice simultaneously for all locations at a frequency of 250 Hz for a period of 5 s.
Results:
Vibration applied over the internal oblique and erector spinae muscle locations induced a postural shift in the direction of the stimulation regardless of the tactor type. For the aforementioned four locations, the root-mean-square (RMS) and power spectral density (PSD) of the body sway in both the A/P and M/L directions were also significantly greater during the vibration than before or after, and were greater for the C2 tactors than for the Tactaid tactors. However, simultaneous activation of all tactors or those over the external oblique muscle locations did not produce significant postural responses regardless of the tactor type.
Conclusion:
The results suggest that the use of a torso-based vibrotactile sensory augmentation display should carefully consider the tactor type as well as the instruction of corrective movements. Attractive instructional cues (&quot;move in the direction of the vibration&quot;) are compatible with the observed non-volitional response to stimulation and may facilitate postural adjustments during vibrotactile biofeedback balance applications.</description>

<title>True functional ability of chronic stroke patients</title>
<description>Background:
There is a paucity of information regarding visuospatial (VS) and visuomotor (VM) task performance in patients with chronic right fronto-parietal lobe stroke, as the majority of knowledge to date in this realm has been gleaned from acute stroke patients. The goal of this paper is to determine how VS and VM performance in chronic stroke patients compare to the performance of healthy participants.
Methods:
Nine patients with stroke involving the right fronto-parietal region were evaluated against match controls on neuropsychological tests and a computerized visuomotor assessment task.
Results:
Initial evaluation indicated that performance between participant groups were relatively similar on all measures. However, an in-depth analysis of variability revealed observable differences between participant groups. In addition, large effect sizes were also observed supporting the theory that using only conventional examination (e.g., p-values) measures may result in miss-identifying crucial stroke-related differences.
Conclusion:
Through conventional evaluation methods it would appear that the chronic stroke participants had made significant functional gains relatively to a control group many years post-stroke. It was shown that the type of evaluation used is essential to identifying group differences. Thus, supplementary methods of evaluation are required to unmask the true functional ability of individuals many years post-stroke.</description>

<title>Autonomous identification of freezing of gait in Parkinson&apos;s disease from lower-body segmental accelerometry</title>
<description>Background:
We have previously published a technique for objective assessment of freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD) from a single shank-mounted accelerometer. Here we extend this approach to evaluate the optimal configuration of sensor placement and signal processing parameters using seven sensors attached to the lumbar back, thighs, shanks and feet.
Methods:
Multi-segmental acceleration data was obtained from 25 PD patients performing 134 timed up and go tasks, and clinical assessment of FOG was performed by two experienced raters from video. Four metrics were used to compare objective and clinical measures; the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for number of FOG episodes and the percent time frozen per trial; and the sensitivity and specificity of FOG detection.
Results:
The seven-sensor configuration was the most robust, scoring highly on all measures of performance (ICC number of FOG 0.75; ICC percent time frozen 0.80; sensitivity 84.3%; specificity 78.4%). A simpler single-shank sensor approach provided similar ICC values and exhibited a high sensitivity to FOG events, but specificity was lower at 66.7%. Recordings from the lumbar sensor offered only moderate agreement with the clinical raters in terms of absolute number and duration of FOG events (likely due to musculoskeletal attenuation of lower-limb &apos;trembling&apos; during FOG), but demonstrated a high sensitivity (86.2%) and specificity (82.4%) when considered as a binary test for the presence/absence of FOG within a single trial.
Conclusions:
The seven-sensor approach was the most accurate method for quantifying FOG, and is best suited to demanding research applications. A single shank sensor provided measures comparable to the seven-sensor approach but is relatively straightforward in execution, facilitating clinical use. A single lumbar sensor may provide a simple means of objective FOG detection given the ubiquitous nature of accelerometers in mobile telephones and other belt-worn devices.</description>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Neurogenesis must be properly regulated to ensure that cell production does not exceed the requirements of the growing cerebral cortex, yet our understanding of mechanisms that restrain neuron production remains incomplete. We investigated the function of microglial cells in the developing cerebral cortex of prenatal and postnatal macaques and rats and show that microglia limit the production of cortical neurons by phagocytosing neural precursor cells. We show that microglia selectively colonize the cortical proliferative zones and phagocytose neural precursor cells as neurogenesis nears completion. We found that deactivating microglia <I>in utero</I> with tetracyclines or eliminating microglia from the fetal cerebral cortex with liposomal clodronate significantly increased the number of neural precursor cells, while activating microglia <I>in utero</I> through maternal immune activation significantly decreased the number of neural precursor cells. These data demonstrate that microglia play a fundamental role in regulating the size of the precursor cell pool in the developing cerebral cortex, expanding our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate cortical development. Furthermore, our data suggest that any factor that alters the number or activation state of microglia <I>in utero</I> can profoundly affect neural development and affect behavioral outcomes.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Inhibition of a SNARE-Sensitive Pathway in Astrocytes Attenuates Damage following Stroke]]></title>
<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4234?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>A strong body of research has defined the role of excitotoxic glutamate in animal models of brain ischemia and stroke; however, clinical trials of glutamate receptor antagonists have demonstrated their limited capacity to prevent brain damage following ischemia. We propose that astrocyte&ndash;neuron signaling represents an important modulatory target that may be useful in mediating damage following stroke. To assess the impact of astrocyte signaling on damage following stroke, we have used the astrocyte-specific dominant-negative SNARE mouse model (dnSNARE). Recent findings have shown that the astrocytic SNARE signaling pathway can affect neuronal excitability by regulating the surface expression of NMDA receptors. Using focal photothrombosis via the Rose Bengal method, as well as excitotoxic NMDA lesions, we show that dnSNARE animals exhibited a sparing of damaged tissue quantified using Nissl and NeuN staining. At the same time point, animals were also tested in behavioral tasks that probe the functional integrity of stroke- or lesion-damaged motor and somatosensory areas. We found that dnSNARE mice performed significantly better than littermate controls on rung walk and adhesive dot removal tasks following lesion. Together, our results demonstrate the important role of astrocytic signaling under ischemic conditions. Drugs targeting astrocyte signaling have a potential benefit for the outcome of stroke in human patients by limiting the spread of damage.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Perineurial Glia Require Notch Signaling during Motor Nerve Development but Not Regeneration]]></title>
<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4241?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Motor nerves play the critical role of shunting information out of the CNS to targets in the periphery. Their formation requires the coordinated development of distinct cellular components, including motor axons and the Schwann cells and perineurial glia that ensheath them. During nervous system assembly, these glial cells must migrate long distances and terminally differentiate, ensuring the efficient propagation of action potentials. Although we know quite a bit about the mechanisms that control Schwann cell development during this process, nothing is known about the mechanisms that mediate the migration and differentiation of perineurial glia. Using <I>in vivo</I> imaging in zebrafish, we demonstrate that Notch signaling is required for both perineurial migration and differentiation during nerve formation, but not regeneration. Interestingly, loss of Notch signaling in perineurial cells also causes a failure of Schwann cell differentiation, demonstrating that Schwann cells require perineurial glia for aspects of their own development. These studies describe a novel mechanism that mediates multiple aspects of perineurial development and reveal the critical importance of perineurial glia for Schwann cell maturation and nerve formation.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Spinal Efference Copy Signaling and Gaze Stabilization during Locomotion in Juvenile Xenopus Frogs]]></title>
<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4253?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>In swimming <I>Xenopus laevis</I> tadpoles, gaze stabilization is achieved by efference copies of spinal locomotory CPG output that produce rhythmic extraocular motor activity appropriate for minimizing motion-derived visual disturbances. During metamorphosis, <I>Xenopus</I> switches its locomotory mechanism from larval tail-based undulatory movements to bilaterally synchronous hindlimb kick propulsion in the adult. The change in locomotory mode leads to body motion dynamics that no longer require conjugate left&ndash;right eye rotations for effective retinal image stabilization. Using <I>in vivo</I> kinematic analyses, <I>in vitro</I> electrophysiological recordings and specific CNS lesions, we have investigated spino-extraocular motor coupling in the juvenile frog and the underlying neural pathways to understand how gaze control processes are altered in accordance with the animal's change in body plan and locomotor strategy. Recordings of extraocular and limb motor nerves during spontaneous "fictive" swimming in isolated CNS preparations revealed that there is indeed a corresponding change in spinal efference copy control of extraocular motor output. In contrast to fictive larval swimming where alternating bursts occur in bilateral antagonistic horizontal extraocular nerves, during adult fictive limb-kicking, these motor nerves are synchronously active in accordance with the production of convergent eye movements during the linear head accelerations resulting from forward propulsion. Correspondingly, the neural pathways mediating spino-extraocular coupling have switched from contralateral to strictly ipsilateral ascending influences that ensure a coactivation of bilateral extraocular motoneurons with synchronous left&ndash;right limb extensions. Thus, adaptive developmental plasticity during metamorphosis enables spinal CPG-driven extraocular motor activity to match the changing requirements for eye movement control during self-motion.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Serotonin Facilitates Peripheral Pain Sensitivity in a Manner That Depends on the Nonproton Ligand Sensing Domain of ASIC3 Channel]]></title>
<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4265?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Tissue acidosis and inflammatory mediators play critical roles in inflammatory pain. Extracellular acidosis activates acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), which have emerged as key sensors for extracellular protons in the central and peripheral nervous systems and play key roles in pain sensation and transmission. Additionally, inflammatory mediators, such as serotonin (5-HT), are known to enhance pain sensation. However, functional interactions among protons, inflammatory mediators, and ASICs in pain sensation are poorly understood. In the present study, we show that 5-HT, a classical pro-inflammatory mediator, specifically enhances the proton-evoked sustained, but not transient, currents mediated by homomeric ASIC3 channels and heteromeric ASIC3/1a and ASIC3/1b channels. Unexpectedly, the effect of 5-HT on ASIC3 channels does not involve activation of 5-HT receptors, but is mediated via a functional interaction between 5-HT and ASIC3 channels. We further show that the effect of 5-HT on ASIC3 channels depends on the newly identified nonproton ligand sensing domain. Finally, coapplication of 5-HT and acid significantly increased pain-related behaviors as assayed by the paw-licking test in mice, which was largely attenuated in ASIC3 knock-out mice, and inhibited by the nonselective ASIC inhibitor amiloride. Together, these data identify ASIC3 channels as an unexpected molecular target for acute actions of 5-HT in inflammatory pain sensation and reveal an important role of ASIC3 channels in regulating inflammatory pain via coincident detection of extracellular protons and inflammatory mediators.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a recessive neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by the selective loss of spinal motor neurons. No available therapy exists for SMA, which represents one of the leading genetic causes of death in childhood. SMA is caused by a mutation of the survival-of-motor-neuron 1 (<I>SMN1</I>) gene, leading to a quantitative defect in the survival-motor-neuron (SMN) protein expression. All patients retain one or more copies of the <I>SMN</I>2 gene, which modulates the disease severity by producing a small amount of stable SMN protein. We reported recently that NMDA receptor activation, directly in the spinal cord, significantly enhanced the transcription rate of the <I>SMN2</I> genes in a mouse model of very severe SMA (referred as type 1) by a mechanism that involved AKT/CREB pathway activation. Here, we provide the first compelling evidence for a competition between the MEK/ERK/Elk-1 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/CREB signaling pathways for <I>SMN2</I> gene regulation in the spinal cord of type 1 SMA-like mice. The inhibition of the MEK/ERK/Elk-1 pathway promotes the AKT/CREB pathway activation, leading to (1) an enhanced SMN expression in the spinal cord of SMA-like mice and in human SMA myotubes and (2) a 2.8-fold lifespan extension in SMA-like mice. Furthermore, we identified a crosstalk between ERK and AKT signaling pathways that involves the calcium-dependent modulation of CaMKII activity. Together, all these data open new perspectives to the therapeutic strategy for SMA patients.</p>

<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4295?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>The transcription factor FosB and the brain-enriched calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII&alpha;) are induced in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) by chronic exposure to cocaine or other psychostimulant drugs of abuse, in which the two proteins mediate sensitized drug responses. Although FosB and CaMKII&alpha; both regulate AMPA glutamate receptor expression and function in NAc, dendritic spine formation on NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs), and locomotor sensitization to cocaine, no direct link between these molecules has to date been explored. Here, we demonstrate that FosB is phosphorylated by CaMKII&alpha; at the protein-stabilizing Ser27 and that CaMKII is required for the cocaine-mediated accumulation of FosB in rat NAc. Conversely, we show that FosB is both necessary and sufficient for cocaine induction of CaMKII&alpha; gene expression <I>in vivo</I>, an effect selective for D<SUB>1</SUB>-type MSNs in the NAc shell subregion. Furthermore, induction of dendritic spines on NAc MSNs and increased behavioral responsiveness to cocaine after NAc overexpression of FosB are both CaMKII dependent. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time induction of FosB and CaMKII in the NAc of human cocaine addicts, suggesting possible targets for future therapeutic intervention. These data establish that FosB and CaMKII engage in a cell-type- and brain-region-specific positive feedforward loop as a key mechanism for regulating the reward circuitry of the brain in response to chronic cocaine.</p>

<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4308?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>NADPH oxidase-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) are highly implicated in the development of angiotensin II (AngII)-dependent hypertension mediated in part through the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). This region contains vasopressin and non-vasopressin neurons that are responsive to cardiovascular dysregulation, but it is not known whether ROS is generated by one or both cell types in response to "slow-pressor" infusion of AngII. We addressed this question using ROS imaging and electron microscopic dual labeling for vasopressin and p47<sup>phox</sup>, a cytoplasmic NADPH oxidase subunit requiring mobilization to membranes for the initiation of ROS production. C57BL/6 mice or vasopressin-enhanced green fluorescent protein (VP&ndash;eGFP) mice were infused systemically with saline or AngII (600 ng &middot; kg<sup>&ndash;1</sup> &middot; min<sup>&ndash;1</sup>, s.c.) for 2 weeks, during which they slowly developed hypertension. Ultrastructural analysis of the PVN demonstrated p47<sup>phox</sup> immunolabeling in many glial and neuronal profiles, most of which were postsynaptic dendrites. Compared with saline, AngII recipient mice had a significant increase in p47<sup>phox</sup> immunolabeling on endomembranes just beneath the plasmalemmal surface (+42.1 &plusmn; 11.3%; <I>p</I> &lt; 0.05) in non-vasopressin dendrites. In contrast, AngII infusion decreased p47<sup>phox</sup> immunolabeling on the plasma membrane (&ndash;35.5 &plusmn; 16.5%; <I>p</I> &lt; 0.05) in vasopressin dendrites. Isolated non-VP&ndash;eGFP neurons from the PVN of AngII-infused mice also showed an increase in baseline ROS production not seen in VP&ndash;eGFP neurons. Our results suggest that chronic low-dose AngII may offset the homeostatic control of blood pressure by differentially affecting membrane assembly of NADPH oxidase and ROS production in vasopressin and non-vasopressin neurons located within the PVN.</p>

<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4317?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Memory consolidation has been suggested to be protein synthesis dependent. Previous data indicate that BDNF-induced dendritic protein synthesis is a key event in memory formation through activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. BDNF also activates calpain, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease, which has been shown to play a critical role in learning and memory. This study was therefore directed at testing the hypothesis that calpain activity is required for BDNF-stimulated local protein synthesis, and at identifying the underlying molecular mechanism. In rat hippocampal slices, cortical synaptoneurosomes, and cultured neurons, BDNF-induced mTOR pathway activation and protein translation were blocked by calpain inhibition. BDNF treatment rapidly reduced levels of hamartin and tuberin, negative regulators of mTOR, in a calpain-dependent manner. Treatment of brain homogenates with purified calpain-1 and calpain-2 truncated both proteins. BDNF treatment increased phosphorylation of both Akt and ERK, but only the effect on Akt was blocked by calpain inhibition. Levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a phosphatase that inactivates Akt, were decreased following BDNF treatment, and calpain inhibition reversed this effect. Calpain-2, but not calpain-1, treatment of brain homogenates resulted in PTEN degradation. In cultured cortical neurons, knockdown of calpain-2, but not calpain-1, by small interfering RNA completely suppressed the effect of BDNF on mTOR activation. Our results reveal a critical role for calpain-2 in BDNF-induced mTOR signaling and dendritic protein synthesis via PTEN, hamartin, and tuberin degradation. This mechanism therefore provides a link between proteolysis and protein synthesis that might contribute to synaptic plasticity.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Adenosine signaling has been implicated in the pathophysiology of many psychiatric disorders including alcoholism. Striatal adenosine A<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors (A<SUB>2A</SUB>R) play an essential role in both ethanol drinking and the shift from goal-directed action to habitual behavior. However, direct evidence for a role of striatal A<SUB>2A</SUB>R signaling in ethanol drinking and habit development has not been established. In the present study, we found that decreased A<SUB>2A</SUB>R-mediated CREB activity in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) enhanced initial behavioral acquisition of goal-directed behaviors and the vulnerability to progress to excessive ethanol drinking during operant conditioning in mice lacking ethanol-sensitive adenosine transporter ENT1 (ENT1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>). Using mice expressing &beta;-galactosidase (lacZ) under the control of seven repeated CRE sites in both genotypes (CRE-lacZ/ENT1<sup>+/+</sup> mice and CRE-lacZ/ENT1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice) and the dominant-negative form of CREB, we found that reduced CREB activity in the DMS was causally associated with decreased A<SUB>2A</SUB>R signaling and increased goal-directed ethanol drinking. Finally, we have demonstrated that the A<SUB>2A</SUB>R antagonist ZM241385 dampened protein kinase A activity&ndash;mediated signaling in the DMS and promoted excessive ethanol drinking in ENT1<sup>+/+</sup> mice, but not in ENT1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Our results indicate that A<SUB>2A</SUB>R-mediated CREB signaling in the DMS is a key determinant in enhancing the development of goal-directed ethanol drinking in mice.</p>

<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4339?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>The everyday act of speaking involves the complex processes of speech motor control. An important component of control is monitoring, detection, and processing of errors when auditory feedback does not correspond to the intended motor gesture. Here we show, using fMRI and converging operations within a multivoxel pattern analysis framework, that this sensorimotor process is supported by functionally differentiated brain networks. During scanning, a real-time speech-tracking system was used to deliver two acoustically different types of distorted auditory feedback or unaltered feedback while human participants were vocalizing monosyllabic words, and to present the same auditory stimuli while participants were passively listening. Whole-brain analysis of neural-pattern similarity revealed three functional networks that were differentially sensitive to distorted auditory feedback during vocalization, compared with during passive listening. One network of regions appears to encode an "error signal" regardless of acoustic features of the error: this network, including right angular gyrus, right supplementary motor area, and bilateral cerebellum, yielded consistent neural patterns across acoustically different, distorted feedback types, only during articulation (not during passive listening). In contrast, a frontotemporal network appears sensitive to the speech features of auditory stimuli during passive listening; this preference for speech features was diminished when the same stimuli were presented as auditory concomitants of vocalization. A third network, showing a distinct functional pattern from the other two, appears to capture aspects of both neural response profiles. Together, our findings suggest that auditory feedback processing during speech motor control may rely on multiple, interactive, functionally differentiated neural systems.</p>

<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4349?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Endocannabinoids (eCBs) play an important role in long-term regulation of synaptic signaling in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In this study, the role of transcription- and translation-dependent processes in presynaptic versus postsynaptic neurons was examined during eCB-mediated synaptic plasticity in the CNS of the leech. Low-frequency stimulation (LFS) of non-nociceptive afferents elicits eCB-dependent long-term depression (eCB&ndash;LTD) heterosynaptically in nociceptive synapses that lasts at least 2 h. Bath application of emetine, a protein synthesis inhibitor, blocked eCB&ndash;LTD after afferent LFS or exogenous eCB application, indicating that this depression was translation dependent. Bath application of actinomycin D, an irreversible RNA synthesis inhibitor, or 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole 1-&beta;-<scp>d</scp>-ribofurandoside (DRB), a reversible RNA synthesis inhibitor, also prevented eCB&ndash;LTD. Selective injection of DRB or emetine into the presynaptic or postsynaptic neuron before LFS indicated that eCB&ndash;LTD required transcription and translation in the postsynaptic neuron but only translation in the presynaptic cell. Depression observed immediately after LFS was also blocked when these transcription- and translation-dependent processes were inhibited. It is proposed that induction of eCB&ndash;LTD in this nociceptive synapse requires the coordination of presynaptic protein synthesis and postsynaptic mRNA and protein synthesis. These findings provide significant insights into both eCB-based synaptic plasticity and understanding how activity in non-nociceptive afferents modulates nociceptive pathways.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>The response of a sensory neuron to an unchanging stimulus typically adapts, showing decreases in response gain that are accompanied by changes in the shape of tuning curves. It remains unclear whether these changes arise purely due to spike rate adaptation within single neurons or whether they are dependent on network interactions between neurons. Further, it is unclear how the timescales of neural and perceptual adaptation are related. To examine this issue, we compared speed tuning of middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal neurons in macaque visual cortex after adaptation to two different reference speeds. For 75% of speed-tuned units, adaptation caused significant changes in tuning that could be explained equally well as lateral shifts, vertical gain changes, or both. These tuning changes occurred rapidly, as both neuronal firing rate and Fano factor showed no evidence of changing beyond the first 500 ms after motion onset, and the magnitude of tuning curve changes showed no difference between trials with adaptation durations shorter or longer than 1 s. Importantly, the magnitude of tuning shifts was correlated with the transient-sustained index, which measures a well characterized form of rapid response adaptation in MT, and is likely associated with changes at the level of neuronal networks. Tuning curves changed in a manner that increased neuronal sensitivity around the adapting speed, consistent with improvements in human and macaque psychophysical performance that we observed over the first several hundred ms of adaptation.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins classically function as negative modulators of G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. <I>In vitro</I>, RGS proteins have been shown to inhibit signaling by agonists at the &mu;-opioid receptor, including morphine. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the contribution of endogenous RGS proteins to the antinociceptive effects of morphine and other opioid agonists. To do this, a knock-in mouse that expresses an RGS-insensitive (RGSi) mutant G&alpha;<SUB>o</SUB> protein, G&alpha;<SUB>o</SUB><sup>G184S</sup> (G&alpha;<SUB>o</SUB> RGSi), was evaluated for morphine or methadone antinociception in response to noxious thermal stimuli. Mice expressing G&alpha;<SUB>o</SUB> RGSi subunits exhibited a naltrexone-sensitive enhancement of baseline latency in both the hot-plate and warm-water tail-withdrawal tests. In the hot-plate test, a measure of supraspinal nociception, morphine antinociception was increased, and this was associated with an increased ability of opioids to inhibit presynaptic GABA neurotransmission in the periaqueductal gray. In contrast, antinociception produced by either morphine or methadone was reduced in the tail-withdrawal test, a measure of spinal nociception. In whole-brain and spinal cord homogenates from mice expressing G&alpha;<SUB>o</SUB> RGSi subunits, there was a small loss of G&alpha;<SUB>o</SUB> expression and an accompanying decrease in basal G-protein activity. Our results strongly support a role for RGS proteins as negative regulators of opioid supraspinal antinociception and also reveal a potential novel function of RGS proteins as positive regulators of opioid spinal antinociceptive pathways.</p>

<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4378?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>We studied the contribution of the rostral mPFC (rmPFC) to the acquisition and performance of classical eyeblink conditioning in rabbits using a delay paradigm. The rmPFC was determined by its afferent projections from the medial half of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. The rmPFC neurons were identified by their antidromic activation from the mediodorsal nucleus and/or by their firing characteristics. The rmPFC neurons increased their firing during the first conditioning sessions, but decreased it when conditioned responses (CRs) reached asymptotic values. Therefore, no significant relationships could be established between neuronal firing rates and the percentage of CRs or the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the orbicularis oculi muscle during conditioning. Electrical train stimulation of the rmPFC produced a significant inhibition of air-puff&ndash;evoked blinks and reduced the generation of CRs compared with controls. Inhibition of the rmPFC by the local injection of lidocaine produced an increase in the amplitude of evoked reflex and conditioned eyeblinks and in the percentage of CRs. The rmPFC seems to be a potent inhibitor of reflex and conditioned eyeblinks, controlling the release of newly acquired eyelid responses until advanced stages of the acquisition process&mdash;i.e., until the need for the acquired response is fully confirmed. Therefore, the rmPFC seems to act as a "flip-flop" mechanism in controlling behavior.</p>

<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4387?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) is expressed in the brain and has been detected in macrophages, microglia, and neurons. ABCA7 promotes efflux of lipids from cells to apolipoproteins and can also regulate phagocytosis and modulate processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate the Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) peptide. Genome-wide association studies have indicated that <I>ABCA7</I> single nucleotide polymorphisms confer increased risk for late-onset AD; however, the role that ABCA7 plays in the brain in the AD context is unknown. In the present study, we crossed ABCA7-deficient (A7<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) mice with J20 amyloidogenic mice to address this issue. We show that ABCA7 loss doubled insoluble A&beta; levels and thioflavine-S&ndash;positive plaques in the brain. This was not related to changes in APP processing (assessed by analysis of full-length APP and the APP &beta; C-terminal fragment). Apolipoprotein E regulates cerebral A&beta; homeostasis and plaque load; however, the apolipoprotein E concentration was not altered by ABCA7 loss. Spatial reference memory was significantly impaired in both J20 and J20/A7<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice compared with wild-type mice; however, there were no cognitive differences between J20 and J20/A7<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. There were also no major differences detected in hippocampal or plaque-associated microglial/macrophage markers between J20 and J20/A7<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice, whereas the capacity for bone marrow-derived macrophages derived from A7<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice to take up oligomeric A&beta; was reduced by 51% compared with wild-type mice. Our results suggest that ABCA7 plays a role in the regulation of A&beta; homeostasis in the brain and that this may be related to altered phagocyte function.</p>

<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4395?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>In hair cells of the inner ear, sound or head movement increases tension in fine filaments termed tip links, which in turn convey force to mechanosensitive ion channels to open them. Tip links are formed by a tetramer of two cadherin proteins: protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and cadherin 23 (CDH23), which have 11 and 27 extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, respectively. Mutations in either protein cause inner ear disorders in mice and humans. We showed recently that these two cadherins bind tip-to-tip in a "handshake" mode that involves the EC1 and EC2 repeats of both proteins. However, a paucity of appropriate animal models has slowed our understanding both of the interaction and of how mutations of residues within the predicted interface compromise tip link integrity. Here, we present <I>noddy</I>, a new mouse model for hereditary deafness. Identified in a forward genetic screen, <I>noddy</I> homozygotes lack inner ear function. Mapping and sequencing showed that <I>noddy</I> mutant mice harbor an isoleucine-to-asparagine (I108N) mutation in the EC1 repeat of PCDH15. Residue I108 interacts with CDH23 EC2 in the handshake and its mutation impairs the interaction <I>in vitro</I>. The <I>noddy</I> mutation allowed us to determine the consequences of blocking the handshake <I>in vivo</I>: tip link formation and bundle morphology are disrupted, and mechanotransduction channels fail to remain open at rest. These results offer new insights into the interaction between PCDH15 and CDH23 and help explain the etiology of human deafness linked to mutations in the tip-link interface.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Cisplatin, one of the most commonly used anticancer drugs, is known to cause inner ear hair cell damage and hearing loss. Despite much investigation into mechanisms of cisplatin-induced hair cell death, little is known about the mechanism whereby cisplatin is selectively toxic to hair cells. Using hair cells of the zebrafish lateral line, we found that chemical inhibition of mechanotransduction with quinine and EGTA protected against cisplatin-induced hair cell death. Furthermore, we found that the zebrafish mutants <I>mariner</I> (<I>myo7aa</I>) and <I>sputnik</I> (<I>cad23</I>) that lack functional mechanotransduction were resistant to cisplatin-induced hair cell death. Using a fluorescent analog of cisplatin, we found that chemical or genetic inhibition of mechanotransduction prevented its uptake. These findings demonstrate that cisplatin-induced hair cell death is dependent on functional mechanotransduction in the zebrafish lateral line.</p>

<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4415?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Visual input is remarkably diverse. Certain sensory inputs are more probable than others, mirroring statistical regularities of the visual environment. The visual system exploits many of these regularities, resulting, on average, in better inferences about visual stimuli. However, by incorporating prior knowledge into perceptual decisions, visual processing can also result in perceptions that do not match sensory inputs. Such perceptual biases can often reveal unique insights into underlying mechanisms and computations. For example, a prior assumption that objects move slowly can explain a wide range of motion phenomena. The prior on slow speed is usually rationalized by its match with visual input, which typically includes stationary or slow moving objects. However, this only holds for foveal and parafoveal stimulation. The visual periphery tends to be exposed to faster motions, which are biased toward centrifugal directions. Thus, if prior assumptions derive from experience, peripheral motion processing should be biased toward centrifugal speeds. Here, in experiments with human participants, we support this hypothesis and report a novel visual illusion where stationary objects in the visual periphery are perceived as moving centrifugally, while objects moving as fast as 7&deg;/s toward fovea are perceived as stationary. These behavioral results were quantitatively explained by a Bayesian observer that has a strong centrifugal prior. This prior is consistent with both the prevalence of centrifugal motions in the visual periphery and a centrifugal bias of direction tuning in cortical area MT, supporting the notion that visual processing mirrors its input statistics.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Plasticity of Hypothalamic Dopamine Neurons during Lactation Results in Dissociation of Electrical Activity and Release]]></title>
<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4424?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons are the central regulators of prolactin (PRL) secretion. Their extensive functional plasticity allows a change from low PRL secretion in the non-pregnant state to the condition of hyperprolactinemia that characterizes lactation. To allow this rise in PRL, TIDA neurons are thought to become unresponsive to PRL at lactation and functionally silenced. Here we show that, contrary to expectations, the electrical properties of the system were not modified during lactation and that the neurons remained electrically responsive to a PRL stimulus, with PRL inducing an acute increase in their firing rate during lactation that was identical to that seen in non-pregnant mice. Furthermore, we show a long-term organization of TIDA neuron electrical activity with an harmonization of their firing rates, which remains intact during lactation. However, PRL-induced secretion of dopamine (DA) at the median eminence was strongly blunted during lactation, at least in part attributable to lack of phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase, the key enzyme involved in DA synthesis. We therefore conclude that lactation, rather than involving electrical silencing of TIDA neurons, represents a condition of decoupling between electrical activity at the cell body and DA secretion at the median eminence.</p>

<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4434?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>The concept of a tripartite synapse including a presynaptic terminal, a postsynaptic spine, and an astrocytic process that responds to neuronal activity by fast gliotransmitter release, confers to the electrically silent astrocytes an active role in information processing. However, the mechanisms of gliotransmitter release are still highly controversial. The reported expression of all three vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT1&ndash;3) by astrocytes suggests that astrocytes, like neurons, may release glutamate by exocytosis. However, the demonstration of astrocytic VGLUT expression is largely based on immunostaining, and the possibility of nonspecific labeling needs to be systematically addressed. We therefore examined the expression of VGLUT1&ndash;3 in astrocytes, both in culture and <I>in situ</I>. We used Western blots and single-vesicle imaging by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in live cultured astrocytes, and confocal microscopy, at the cellular level in cortical, hippocampal, and cerebellar brain slices, combined with quantitative image analysis. Control experiments were systematically performed in cultured astrocytes using wild-type, VGLUT1&ndash;3 knock-out, VGLUT1<sup>Venus</sup> knock-in, and VGLUT2-EGFP transgenic mice. In fixed brain slices, we quantified the degree of overlap between VGLUT1&ndash;3 and neuronal or astrocytic markers, both in an object-based manner using fluorescence line profiles, and in a pixel-based manner using dual-color scatter plots followed by the calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficient over all pixels with intensities significantly different from background. Our data provide no evidence in favor of the expression of any of the three VGLUTs by gray matter protoplasmic astrocytes of the primary somatosensory cortex, the thalamic ventrobasal nucleus, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum.</p>

<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4456?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Inner hair cells (IHCs) of the cochlea use ribbon synapses to transmit auditory information faithfully to spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). In the present study, we used genetic disruption of the presynaptic scaffold protein bassoon in mice to manipulate the morphology and function of the IHC synapse. Although partial-deletion mutants lacking functional bassoon (Bsn<sup>Ex4/5</sup>) had a near-complete loss of ribbons from the synapses (up to 88% ribbonless synapses), gene-trap mutants (Bsn<sup>gt</sup>) showed weak residual expression of bassoon and 56% ribbonless synapses, whereas the remaining 44% had a loosely anchored ribbon. Patch-clamp recordings and synaptic Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.3 immunolabeling indicated a larger number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels for Bsn<sup>gt</sup> IHCs compared with Bsn<sup>Ex4/5</sup> IHCs and for Bsn<sup>gt</sup> ribbon-occupied versus Bsn<sup>gt</sup> ribbonless synapses. An intermediate phenotype of Bsn<sup>gt</sup> IHCs was also found by membrane capacitance measurements for sustained exocytosis, but not for the size of the readily releasable vesicle pool. The frequency and amplitude of EPSCs were reduced in Bsn<sup>Ex4/5</sup> mouse SGNs, whereas their postsynaptic AMPA receptor clusters were largely unaltered. Sound coding in SGN, assessed by recordings of single auditory nerve fibers and their population responses <I>in vivo</I>, was similarly affected in Bsn<sup>gt</sup> and Bsn<sup>Ex4/5</sup> mice. Both genotypes showed impaired sound onset coding and reduced evoked and spontaneous spike rates. In summary, reduced bassoon expression or complete lack of full-length bassoon impaired sound encoding to a similar extent, which is consistent with the comparable reduction of the readily releasable vesicle pool. This suggests that the remaining loosely anchored ribbons in Bsn<sup>gt</sup> IHCs were functionally inadequate or that ribbon independent mechanisms dominated the coding deficit.</p>

<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4468?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a matricellular protein that modulates the activity of growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix to play multiple roles in tissue development and repair, such as cellular adhesion, migration, and proliferation. Throughout the CNS, SPARC is highly localized in mature ramified microglia, but its role in microglia&mdash;in development or during response to disease or injury&mdash;is not understood. In the postnatal brain, immature amoeboid myeloid precursors only induce SPARC expression after they cease proliferation and migration, and transform into mature, ramified resting microglia. SPARC null/CX3CR1-GFP reporter mice reveal that SPARC regulates the distribution and branching of mature microglia, with significant differences between cortical gray and white matter in both controls and SPARC nulls. Following ischemic and excitotoxic lesion, reactive, hypertrophic microglia rapidly downregulate and release SPARC at the lesion, concomitant with reactive, hypertrophic perilesion astrocytes upregulating SPARC. After photothrombotic stroke in the forelimb sensorimotor cortex, SPARC nulls demonstrate enhanced microgliosis in and around the lesion site, which accompanies significantly enhanced functional recovery by 32 d after lesion. Microglia from SPARC nulls also intrinsically proliferate at a greater rate <I>in vitro</I>&mdash;an enhanced effect that can be rescued by the addition of exogenous SPARC. SPARC is thus a novel regulator of microglial proliferation and structure, and, in addition to regulating glioma progression, may play an important role in differently regulating the gray and white matter microglial responses to CNS lesion&mdash;and modulating behavioral recovery&mdash;after injury.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Noninvasive brain stimulation provides a potential tool for affecting brain functions in the typical and atypical brain and offers in several cases an alternative to pharmaceutical intervention. Some studies have suggested that transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), a form of noninvasive brain stimulation, can also be used to enhance cognitive performance. Critically, research so far has primarily focused on optimizing protocols for effective stimulation, or assessing potential physical side effects of TES while neglecting the possibility of cognitive side effects. We assessed this possibility by targeting the high-level cognitive abilities of learning and automaticity in the mathematical domain. Notably, learning and automaticity represent critical abilities for potential cognitive enhancement in typical and atypical populations. Over 6 d, healthy human adults underwent cognitive training on a new numerical notation while receiving TES to the posterior parietal cortex or the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Stimulation to the the posterior parietal cortex facilitated numerical learning, whereas automaticity for the learned material was impaired. In contrast, stimulation to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired the learning process, whereas automaticity for the learned material was enhanced. The observed double dissociation indicates that cognitive enhancement through TES can occur at the expense of other cognitive functions. These findings have important implications for the future use of enhancement technologies for neurointervention and performance improvement in healthy populations.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Learning does not only depend on rationality, because real-life learning cannot be isolated from emotion or social factors. Therefore, it is intriguing to determine how emotion changes learning, and to identify which neural substrates underlie this interaction. Here, we show that the task-independent presentation of an emotional face before a reward-predicting cue increases the speed of cue&ndash;reward association learning in human subjects compared with trials in which a neutral face is presented. This phenomenon was attributable to an increase in the learning rate, which regulates reward prediction errors. Parallel to these behavioral findings, functional magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that presentation of an emotional face enhanced reward prediction error (RPE) signal in the ventral striatum. In addition, we also found a functional link between this enhanced RPE signal and increased activity in the amygdala following presentation of an emotional face. Thus, this study revealed an acceleration of cue&ndash;reward association learning by emotion, and underscored a role of striatum&ndash;amygdala interactions in the modulation of the reward prediction errors by emotion.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>An important function of sleep is the consolidation of memories, and features of sleep, such as rapid eye movement (REM) or sleep spindles, have been shown to correlate with improvements in discrete memory domains. Because of the methodological difficulties in modulating sleep, however, a causal link between specific sleep features and human memory consolidation is lacking. Here, we experimentally manipulated specific sleep features during a daytime nap via direct pharmacological intervention. Using zolpidem (Ambien), a short-acting GABA<SUB>A</SUB> agonist hypnotic, we show increased sleep spindle density and decreased REM sleep compared with placebo and sodium oxybate (Xyrem). Naps with increased spindles produced significantly better verbal memory and significantly worse perceptual learning but did not affect motor learning. The experimental spindles were similar to control spindles in amplitude and frequency, suggesting that the experimental intervention enhanced normal sleep processes. Furthermore, using statistical methods, we demonstrate for the first time a critical role of spindles in human hippocampal memory performance. The gains in memory consolidation exceed sleep-alone or control conditions and demonstrate the potential for targeted, exceptional memory enhancement in healthy adults with pharmacologically modified sleep.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Although the majority of first-line antidepressants increase brain serotonin and rare polymorphisms in tryptophan hydroxlase-2 (Tph2), the rate-limiting enzyme in the brain serotonin synthesis pathway, have been identified in cohorts of subjects with major depressive disorder, the circuit level alterations that results from serotonergic hypofunction remain poorly understood. Here we use chronic multicircuit neurophysiological recordings to characterize functional interactions across cortical and limbic circuits in mice engineered to express a human loss-of-function depression allele <I>Tph2</I>-(R441H) [Tph2 knockin (Tph2KI)]. Our results show that Tph2KI mice exhibit increased intra-network synchrony within medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basal amygdala (AMY) and increased inter-network synchrony between these two brain networks. Moreover, we demonstrate that chronic treatment with fluoxetine reverses several of the circuit alterations observed within Tph2KI mice. Together, our findings establish a functional link between functional hyposerotonergia and altered mPFC&ndash;AMY network dynamics.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Dynamin GTPase, a key molecule in endocytosis, mechanically severs the invaginated membrane upon GTP hydrolysis. Dynamin functions also in regulating actin cytoskeleton, but the mechanisms are yet to be defined. Here we show that dynamin 1, a neuronal isoform of dynamin, and cortactin form ring complexes, which twine around F-actin bundles and stabilize them. By negative-staining EM, dynamin 1&ndash;cortactin complexes appeared as "open" or "closed" rings depending on guanine nucleotide conditions. By pyrene actin assembly assay, dynamin 1 stimulated actin assembly in mouse brain cytosol. <I>In vitro</I> incubation of F-actin with both dynamin 1 and cortactin led to the formation of long and thick actin bundles, on which dynamin 1 and cortactin were periodically colocalized in puncta. A depolymerization assay revealed that dynamin 1 and cortactin increased the stability of actin bundles, most prominently in the presence of GTP. In rat cortical neurons and human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, both dynamin 1 and cortactin localized on actin filaments and the bundles at growth cone filopodia as revealed by immunoelectron microscopy. In SH-SY5Y cell, acute inhibition of dynamin 1 by application of dynamin inhibitor led to growth cone collapse. Cortactin knockdown also reduced growth cone filopodia. Together, our results strongly suggest that dynamin 1 and cortactin ring complex mechanically stabilizes F-actin bundles in growth cone filopodia. Thus, the GTPase-dependent mechanochemical enzyme property of dynamin is commonly used both in endocytosis and regulation of F-actin bundles by a dynamin 1&ndash;cortactin complex.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Dopamine signals through D1-like and D2-like receptors, which can stimulate or inhibit, respectively, neuronal activity. Here we assessed the balance between D1 or D2 receptor signaling in the human brain and how it is affected in alcoholism. Using PET, we measured the relationship between changes in dopamine and brain glucose metabolism induced by methylphenidate in controls and alcoholics. We show that methylphenidate induced significant DA increases in striatum, amygdala, and medial orbitofrontal cortex, whereas it decreased metabolism in these brain regions. Methylphenidate-induced dopamine increases were greater in controls than in alcoholics, whereas methylphenidate-induced metabolic decreases were greater in alcoholics. For both groups, methylphenidate-induced dopamine increases were associated with decreases in regional brain metabolism, and the correlations were strongest in subthalamic nuclei, anterior cingulate, and medial orbitofrontal cortex. These correlations were more extensive and robust and the slopes steeper in alcoholics than in controls despite their attenuated dopamine responses to methylphenidate, which suggests an impaired modulation of dopamine signals in the brain of alcoholic subjects. These findings are consistent with a predominant inhibitory effect of dopamine in the human brain that is likely mediated by the prominence of dopamine D2/D3 receptors.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>The influences of axon diameter, myelin thickness, and internodal length on the velocity of conduction of peripheral nerve action potentials are unclear. Previous studies have demonstrated a strong dependence of conduction velocity on internodal length. However, a theoretical analysis has suggested that this relationship may be lost above a nodal separation of ~0.6 mm. Here we measured nerve conduction velocities in a rabbit model of limb lengthening that produced compensatory increases in peripheral nerve growth. Divided tibial bones in one hindlimb were gradually lengthened at 0.7 mm per day using an external frame attached to the bone. This was associated with a significant increase (33%) of internodal length (0.95&ndash;1.3 mm) in axons of the tibial nerve that varied in proportion to the mechanical strain in the nerve of the lengthened limb. Axonal diameter, myelin thickness, and <I>g</I>-ratios were not significantly altered by limb lengthening. Despite the substantial increase in internodal length, no significant change was detected in conduction velocity (~43 m/s) measured either <I>in vivo</I> or in isolated tibial nerves. The results demonstrate that the internode remains plastic in the adult but that increases in internodal length of myelinated adult nerve axons do not result in either deficiency or proportionate increases in their conduction velocity and support the view that the internodal lengths of nerves reach a plateau beyond which their conduction velocities are no longer sensitive to increases in internodal length.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>We used a network approach to assess systems-level abnormalities in motor activation in humans with Parkinson's disease (PD). This was done by measuring the expression of the normal movement-related activation pattern (NMRP), a previously validated activation network deployed by healthy subjects during motor performance. In this study, NMRP expression was prospectively quantified in <sup>15</sup>O-water PET scans from a PD patient cohort comprised of a longitudinal early-stage group (<I>n</I> = 12) scanned at baseline and at two or three follow-up visits two years apart, and a moderately advanced group scanned on and off treatment with either subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (<I>n</I> = 14) or intravenous levodopa infusion (<I>n</I> = 14). For each subject and condition, we measured NMRP expression during both movement and rest. Resting expression of the abnormal PD-related metabolic covariance pattern was likewise determined in the same subjects. NMRP expression was abnormally elevated (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.001) in PD patients scanned in the nonmovement rest state. By contrast, network activity measured during movement did not differ from normal (<I>p</I> = 0.34). In the longitudinal cohort, abnormal increases in resting NMRP expression were evident at the earliest clinical stages (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05), which progressed significantly over time (<I>p</I> = 0.003). Analogous network changes were present at baseline in the treatment cohort (<I>p</I> = 0.001). These abnormalities improved with subthalamic nucleus stimulation (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.005) but not levodopa (<I>p</I> = 0.25). In both cohorts, the changes in NMRP expression that were observed did not correlate with concurrent PD-related metabolic covariance pattern measurements (<I>p</I> &gt; 0.22). Thus, the resting state in PD is characterized by changes in the activity of normal as well as pathological brain networks.</p>

<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4550?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Focused ultrasound is a promising noninvasive technology for neural stimulation. Here we use the isolated salamander retina to characterize the effect of ultrasound on an intact neural circuit and compared these effects with those of visual stimulation of the same retinal ganglion cells. Ultrasound stimuli at an acoustic frequency of 43 MHz and a focal spot diameter of 90 &mu;m delivered from a piezoelectric transducer evoked stable responses with a temporal precision equal to strong visual responses but with shorter latency. By presenting ultrasound and visual stimulation together, we found that ultrasonic stimulation rapidly modulated visual sensitivity but did not change visual temporal filtering. By combining pharmacology with ultrasound stimulation, we found that ultrasound did not directly activate retinal ganglion cells but did in part activate interneurons beyond photoreceptors. These results suggest that, under conditions of strong localized stimulation, timing variability is largely influenced by cells beyond photoreceptors. We conclude that ultrasonic stimulation is an effective and spatiotemporally precise method to activate the retina. Because the retina is the most accessible part of the CNS <I>in vivo</I>, ultrasonic stimulation may have diagnostic potential to probe remaining retinal function in cases of photoreceptor degeneration, and therapeutic potential for use in a retinal prosthesis. In addition, because of its noninvasive properties and spatiotemporal resolution, ultrasound neurostimulation promises to be a useful tool to understand dynamic activity in pharmacologically defined neural pathways in the retina.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Fear Extinction Memory Consolidation Requires Potentiation of Pontine-Wave Activity during REM Sleep]]></title>
<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4561?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Sleep plays an important role in memory consolidation within multiple memory systems including contextual fear extinction memory, but little is known about the mechanisms that underlie this process. Here, we show that fear extinction training in rats, which extinguished conditioned fear, increased both slow-wave sleep and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. Surprisingly, 24 h later, during memory testing, only 57% of the fear-extinguished animals retained fear extinction memory. We found that these animals exhibited an increase in phasic pontine-wave (P-wave) activity during post-training REM sleep, which was absent in the 43% of animals that failed to retain fear extinction memory. The results of this study provide evidence that brainstem activation, specifically potentiation of phasic P-wave activity, during post-training REM sleep is critical for consolidation of fear extinction memory. The results of this study also suggest that, contrary to the popular hypothesis of sleep and memory, increased sleep after training alone does not guarantee consolidation and/or retention of fear extinction memory. Rather, the potentiation of specific sleep-dependent physiological events may be a more accurate predictor for successful consolidation of fear extinction memory. Identification of this unique mechanism will significantly improve our present understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the sleep-dependent regulation of emotional memory. Additionally, this discovery may also initiate development of a new, more targeted treatment method for clinical disorders of fear and anxiety in humans that is more efficacious than existing methods such as exposure therapy that incorporate only fear extinction.</p>

<title><![CDATA[A Sympathetic Neuron Autonomous Role for Egr3-Mediated Gene Regulation in Dendrite Morphogenesis and Target Tissue Innervation]]></title>
<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4570?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Egr3 is a nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced transcriptional regulator that is essential for normal sympathetic nervous system development. Mice lacking Egr3 in the germline have sympathetic target tissue innervation abnormalities and physiologic sympathetic dysfunction similar to humans with dysautonomia. However, since Egr3 is widely expressed and has pleiotropic function, it has not been clear whether it has a role within sympathetic neurons and if so, what target genes it regulates to facilitate target tissue innervation. Here, we show that Egr3 expression within sympathetic neurons is required for their normal innervation since isolated sympathetic neurons lacking Egr3 have neurite outgrowth abnormalities when treated with NGF and mice with sympathetic neuron-restricted Egr3 ablation have target tissue innervation abnormalities similar to mice lacking Egr3 in all tissues. Microarray analysis performed on sympathetic neurons identified many target genes deregulated in the absence of Egr3, with some of the most significantly deregulated genes having roles in axonogenesis, dendritogenesis, and axon guidance. Using a novel genetic technique to visualize axons and dendrites in a subpopulation of randomly labeled sympathetic neurons, we found that Egr3 has an essential role in regulating sympathetic neuron dendrite morphology and terminal axon branching, but not in regulating sympathetic axon guidance to their targets. Together, these results indicate that Egr3 has a sympathetic neuron autonomous role in sympathetic nervous system development that involves modulating downstream target genes affecting the outgrowth and branching of sympathetic neuron dendrites and axons.</p>

<title><![CDATA[A Developmental Shift from Positive to Negative Connectivity in Human Amygdala-Prefrontal Circuitry]]></title>
<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4584?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Recent human imaging and animal studies highlight the importance of frontoamygdala circuitry in the regulation of emotional behavior and its disruption in anxiety-related disorders. Although tracing studies have suggested changes in amygdala&ndash;cortical connectivity through the adolescent period in rodents, less is known about the reciprocal connections within this circuitry across human development, when these circuits are being fine-tuned and substantial changes in emotional control are observed. The present study examined developmental changes in amygdala&ndash;prefrontal circuitry across the ages of 4&ndash;22 years using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results suggest positive amygdala&ndash;prefrontal connectivity in early childhood that switches to negative functional connectivity during the transition to adolescence. Amygdala&ndash;medial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity was significantly positive (greater than zero) among participants younger than 10 years, whereas functional connectivity was significantly negative (less than zero) among participants 10 years and older, over and above the effect of amygdala reactivity. The developmental switch in functional connectivity was paralleled by a steady decline in amygdala reactivity. Moreover, the valence switch might explain age-related improvement in task performance and a developmentally normative decline in anxiety. Initial positive connectivity followed by a valence shift to negative connectivity provides a neurobiological basis for regulatory development and may present novel insight into a more general process of developing regulatory connections.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Brain Changes Associated with Postural Training in Patients with Cerebellar Degeneration: A Voxel-Based Morphometry Study]]></title>
<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4594?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Recent research indicates that physiotherapy can improve motor performance of patients with cerebellar degeneration. Given the known contributions of the cerebellum to motor learning, it remains unclear whether such observable changes in performance are mediated by the cerebellum or cerebral brain areas involved in motor control and learning. The current study addressed this question by assessing the increase in gray matter volume due to sensorimotor training in cerebellar patients using voxel-based morphometry. Nineteen human subjects with pure cerebellar degeneration and matched healthy controls were trained for 2 weeks on a balance task. Postural and clinical assessments along with structural magnetic resonance imaging were performed pretraining and post-training. The main findings were as follows. First, training enhanced balance performance in cerebellar patients. Second, in contrast to controls patients revealed significantly more post-training gray matter volume in the dorsal premotor cortex. Third, training-related increase in gray matter volume was observed within the cerebellum and was more pronounced in controls than in patients. However, statistically cerebellar changes were at the trend level and thus require additional, independent confirmation. We conclude that sensorimotor training of patients with cerebellar neurodegeneration induces gray matter changes primarily within nonaffected neocortical regions of the cerebellar-cortical loop. Residual function of the cerebellum appears to be exploited suggesting either a recovery from degeneration or intact processes of cerebellar plasticity in the remaining healthy tissue.</p>

<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4605?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>The endogenous circadian clock is a principal factor modulating memory across species. Determining the processes through which the circadian clock modulates memory formation is a key issue in understanding and identifying mechanisms to improve memory. We used the marine mollusk <I>Aplysia californica</I> to investigate circadian modulation of intermediate-term memory (ITM) and the mechanisms through which the circadian clock phase specifically suppresses memory using the operant learning paradigm, learning that food is inedible. We found that ITM, a temporally and mechanistically distinct form of memory, is rhythmically expressed under light-dark and constant conditions when induced by either massed or spaced training. Strong circadian regulation of ITM occurs with memory exhibited only by animals trained during the early subjective day; no apparent memory is expressed when training occurs during the late subjective day or night. Given the necessity of multiple persistent kinase cascades for ITM, we investigated whether protein phosphatase activity affected circadian modulation. Inhibition of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A blocked ITM when animals were trained during the early (subjective) day while resulting in phase-specific memory rescue when animals were trained late in the subjective day and early night. In contrast, inhibition of calcineurin did not block ITM when animals were trained during the early day and permitted ITM when animals were trained during the late subjective day, early evening, and throughout the night. These results demonstrate that levels of protein phosphatase activity are critical regulators of ITM and one mechanism through which the circadian clock regulates memory formation.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase 1 Receptor Internalization and Endosomal Signaling Mediate the Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase Activating Polypeptide-Induced Increase in Guinea Pig Cardiac Neuron Excitability]]></title>
<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/33/10/4614?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>After G-protein-coupled receptor activation and signaling at the plasma membrane, the receptor complex is often rapidly internalized via endocytic vesicles for trafficking into various intracellular compartments and pathways. The formation of signaling endosomes is recognized as a mechanism that produces sustained intracellular signals that may be distinct from those generated at the cell surface for cellular responses including growth, differentiation, and survival. Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP; <I>Adcyap1</I>) is a potent neurotransmitter/neurotrophic peptide and mediates its diverse cellular functions in part through internalization of its cognate G-protein-coupled PAC1 receptor (PAC1R; <I>Adcyap1r1</I>). In the present study, we examined whether PAC1R endocytosis participates in the regulation of neuronal excitability. Although PACAP increased excitability in 90% of guinea pig cardiac neurons, pretreatment with Pitstop 2 or dynasore to inhibit clathrin and dynamin I/II, respectively, suppressed the PACAP effect. Subsequent addition of inhibitor after the PACAP-induced increase in excitability developed gradually attenuated excitability with no changes in action potential properties. Likewise, the PACAP-induced increase in excitability was markedly decreased at ambient temperature. Receptor trafficking studies with GFP-PAC1 cell lines demonstrated the efficacy of Pitstop 2, dynasore, and low temperatures at suppressing PAC1R endocytosis. In contrast, brefeldin A pretreatments to disrupt Golgi vesicle trafficking did not blunt the PACAP effect, and PACAP/PAC1R signaling still increased neuronal cAMP production even with endocytic blockade. Our results demonstrate that PACAP/PAC1R complex endocytosis is a key step for the PACAP modulation of cardiac neuron excitability.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Thalamic input to the neocortex is crucial for sensory perception and constitutes the basis of complex awake behavior. Connections within the neocortex play an important role in internally generated neural activity, which is considered critical for memory retrieval and for the generation of imagery in our dreams. Modulatory neurotransmitters, such as noradrenaline and acetylcholine, gate information transmission in the brain. Favero et al. (<I>J Neurophysiol</I> 108: 1010&ndash;1024, 2012) show that modulators differentially facilitate thalamocortical relative to intracortical transmission in the input layers of cortex.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Quantitative inference of population response properties across eccentricity from motion-induced maps in macaque V1]]></title>
<link>http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/109/5/1233?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Interpreting population responses in the primary visual cortex (V1) remains a challenge especially with the advent of techniques measuring activations of large cortical areas simultaneously with high precision. For successful interpretation, a quantitatively precise model prediction is of great importance. In this study, we investigate how accurate a spatiotemporal filter (STF) model predicts average response profiles to coherently drifting random dot motion obtained by optical imaging of intrinsic signals in V1 of anesthetized macaques. We establish that orientation difference maps, obtained by subtracting orthogonal axis-of-motion, invert with increasing drift speeds, consistent with the motion streak effect. Consistent with perception, the speed at which the map inverts (the critical speed) depends on cortical eccentricity and systematically increases from foveal to parafoveal. We report that critical speeds and response maps to drifting motion are excellently reproduced by the STF model. Our study thus suggests that the STF model is quantitatively accurate enough to be used as a first model of choice for interpreting responses obtained with intrinsic imaging methods in V1. We show further that this good quantitative correspondence opens the possibility to infer otherwise not easily accessible population receptive field properties from responses to complex stimuli, such as drifting random dot motions.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Roles of default-mode network and supplementary motor area in human vigilance performance: evidence from real-time fMRI]]></title>
<link>http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/109/5/1250?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>We used real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine which regions of the human brain have a role in vigilance as measured by reaction time (RT) to variably timed stimuli. We first identified brain regions where activation before stimulus presentation predicted RT. Slower RT was preceded by greater activation in the default-mode network, including lateral parietal, precuneus, and medial prefrontal cortices; faster RT was preceded by greater activation in the supplementary motor area (SMA). We examined the roles of these brain regions in vigilance by triggering trials based on brain states defined by blood oxygenation level-dependent activation measured using real-time fMRI. When activation of relevant neural systems indicated either a good brain state (increased activation of SMA) or a bad brain state (increased activation of lateral parietal cortex and precuneus) for performance, a target was presented and RT was measured. RTs on trials triggered by a good brain state were significantly faster than RTs on trials triggered by a bad brain state. Thus human performance was controlled by monitoring brain states that indicated high or low vigilance. These findings identify neural systems that have a role in vigilance and provide direct evidence that the default-mode network has a role in human performance. The ability to control and enhance human behavior based on brain state may have broad implications.</p>

<link>http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/109/5/1259?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>In the course of its interaction with the world, the human nervous system must constantly estimate various variables in the surrounding environment. Past research indicates that environmental variables may be represented as probabilistic distributions of a priori information (priors). Priors for environmental variables that do not change much over time have been widely studied. Little is known, however, about how priors develop in environments with nonstationary statistics. We examine whether humans change their reliance on the prior based on recent changes in environmental variance. Through experimentation, we obtain an online estimate of the human sensorimotor prior (prediction) and then compare it to similar online predictions made by various nonadaptive and adaptive models. Simulations show that models that rapidly adapt to nonstationary components in the environments predict the stimuli better than models that do not take the changing statistics of the environment into consideration. We found that adaptive models best predict participants' responses in most cases. However, we find no support for the idea that this is a consequence of increased reliance on recent experience just after the occurrence of a systematic change in the environment.</p>

<link>http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/109/5/1268?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Primary motor cortex (M1) movement representations reflect acquired motor skills. Representations of muscles and joints used in a skilled task expand. However, it is unknown whether motor restriction in healthy individuals results in complementary reductions in M1 representations. With the use of intracortical microstimulation techniques in squirrel monkeys, detailed maps of movement representations in M1 were derived before and up to 35 wk after restriction of the preferred distal forelimb (DFL) by use of a soft cast. Although total DFL area and movement threshold remained constant, casting resulted in a redistribution of digit and wrist/forearm representations. Digit representations progressively decreased, whereas wrist/forearm representations progressively increased in areal extent. In three of four monkeys, hand preference returned to normal by the end of the postcast recovery period, and postrecovery maps demonstrated reversal of restriction-induced changes. However, in one monkey, a chronic motor impairment occurred in the casted limb. Rehabilitation via a forced-use paradigm resulted in recovery in use and skill of the impaired limb, as well as restoration of normal motor maps. These results demonstrate that plasticity in motor representations can be induced by training or restricting movements of the limb. Physiological changes induced by restriction appear to be reversible, even in the case of adverse motor outcomes. The respective contributions of both disuse and lost motor skills are discussed. These results have relevance for clinical conditions requiring forelimb casting as well as interpreting the differential effects of injury and disuse that are necessarily intertwined after cortical injury, as occurs in stroke.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Evidence regarding the functional subdivisions of human auditory cortex has been slow to converge on a definite model. In part, this reflects inadequacies of current understanding of how the cortex represents temporal information in acoustic signals. To address this, we investigated spatiotemporal properties of auditory responses in human posterolateral superior temporal (PLST) gyrus to acoustic click-train stimuli using intracranial recordings from neurosurgical patients. Subjects were patients undergoing chronic invasive monitoring for refractory epilepsy. The subjects listened passively to acoustic click-train stimuli of varying durations (160 or 1,000 ms) and rates (4&ndash;200 Hz), delivered diotically via insert earphones. Multicontact subdural grids placed over the perisylvian cortex recorded intracranial electrocorticographic responses from PLST and surrounding areas. Analyses focused on averaged evoked potentials (AEPs) and high gamma (70&ndash;150 Hz) event-related band power (ERBP). Responses to click trains featured prominent AEP waveforms and increases in ERBP. The magnitude of AEPs and ERBP typically increased with click rate. Superimposed on the AEPs were frequency-following responses (FFRs), most prominent at 50-Hz click rates but still detectable at stimulus rates up to 200 Hz. Loci with the largest high gamma responses on PLST were often different from those sites that exhibited the strongest FFRs. The data indicate that responses of non-core auditory cortex of PLST represent temporal stimulus features in multiple ways. These include an isomorphic representation of periodicity (as measured by the FFR), a representation based on increases in non-phase-locked activity (as measured by high gamma ERBP), and spatially distributed patterns of activity.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Precisely timed and dynamically balanced excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) conductances underlie the basis of neural network activity. Normal E/I balance is often shifted in epilepsy, resulting in neuronal network hyperexcitability and recurrent seizures. However, dynamics of the actual excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances (<I>g</I><SUB>e</SUB> and <I>g</I><SUB>i</SUB>, respectively) during seizures remain unknown. To study the dynamics of E and I network balance, we calculated <I>g</I><SUB>e</SUB> and <I>g</I><SUB>i</SUB> during the initiation, body, and termination of seizure-like events (SLEs) in the rat hippocampus in vitro. Repetitive emergent SLEs in 4-aminopyridine (100 &mu;M) and reduced extracellular magnesium (0.6 mM) were recorded in the identified CA1 pyramidal cells (PC) and oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) interneurons. Calculated <I>g</I><SUB>e</SUB>/<I>g</I><SUB>i</SUB> ratio dynamics showed that the initiation stage of the SLEs was dominated by inhibition in the PCs and was more balanced in the O-LM cells. During the body of the SLEs, the balance shifted toward excitation, with <I>g</I><SUB>e</SUB> and <I>g</I><SUB>i</SUB> peaking in both cell types at nearly the same time. In the termination phase, PCs were again dominated by inhibition, whereas O-LM cells experienced persistent excitatory synaptic barrage. In this way, increased excitability of interneurons may play roles in both seizure initiation (Ziburkus J, Cressman JR, Barreto E, Schiff SJ. <I>J Neurophysiol</I> 95: 3948&ndash;3954, 2006) and in their termination. Overall, SLE stages can be characterized in PC and O-LM cells by dynamically distinct changes in the balance of <I>g</I><SUB>e</SUB> and <I>g</I><SUB>i</SUB>, where a temporal sequence of imbalance shifts with the changing firing patterns of the cellular subtypes comprising the hyperexcitable microcircuits.</p>

<link>http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/109/5/1307?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>If two people lift and carry an object, they not only produce complementary forces on the object but also walk in synchrony. Previous studies have not examined how two types of coordination strategy are adopted simultaneously. The present study thus tested the hypothesis that complementary and synchronous strategies simultaneously facilitate the action coordination performed by two people. Ten pairs of participants produced periodic isometric forces such that the sum of forces they produced was the target force cycling between 5% and 10% of maximum voluntary contraction with an interval of 1,000 ms (joint action), while individuals alone produced the same target forces with the right hand (individual action). The correlation between forces produced by two participants was highly negative when the total force was visible, indicating that the two participants produced complementary forces. When the image of the total or partner force was presented, the coherence between force-time series produced by two participants was highest at 1 Hz. The relative phase angles were also distributed at the 0&ndash;20&deg; phase region. These innovative findings indicate that two participants simultaneously adopted both complementary and temporal synchronous strategies exclusively when the total force was visible. With the vision of total force, surprisingly, while the joint action exhibited a less variable force than the individual action, the joint action exhibited a smaller absolute error of forces than the individual action. These new findings indicated that the joint action controlled force more accurately than the individual action.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Abnormal GABA-mediated and cerebellar inhibition in women with the fragile X premutation]]></title>
<link>http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/109/5/1315?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>The fragile X syndrome is a mutation-driven developmental disorder caused by a repetition over 200 times of the CGG trinucleotide situated in the 5'-untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (<I>FMR1</I>). The interval between 55 and 199 CGG repeats, which is over the normal range but below full mutation, is named fragile X premutation. Recent studies have focused on the asymptomatic state of fragile X premutation carriers and their potentially relevant preclinical features. However, the underlying neurological mechanisms leading to altered functions in fragile X premutation carriers are still poorly understood. In this study, we wanted to test the hypothesis that asymptomatic women who carry the fragile X premutation present GABAergic and cerebellar abnormalities compared with healthy women without the premutation. We performed noninvasive brain stimulation protocols on both asymptomatic fragile X premutation carriers and controls comprising of measures of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>- and GABA<SUB>B</SUB>-mediated intracortical inhibition, afferent inhibition, and cerebello-motor functional interactions. Premutation carriers presented an absence of cerebellar inhibition over primary motor cortex as well as a reduced GABA<SUB>A</SUB>-mediated intracortical and afferent inhibition compared with healthy nonpremutated controls. These alterations are most probably dependent on a dysfunctional GABAergic mechanism associated with the fragile X premutation condition as previously found in CGG-repeat animal models. Furthermore, the lack of cerebello-motor inhibition could be related to the cerebellar structural abnormalities previously found in carriers of the premutation.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Age-dependent actions of dopamine on inhibitory synaptic transmission in superficial layers of mouse prefrontal cortex]]></title>
<link>http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/109/5/1323?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Numerous developmental changes in the nervous system occur during the first several weeks of the rodent lifespan. Therefore, many characteristics of neuronal function described at the cellular level from in vitro slice experiments conducted during this early time period may not generalize to adult ages. We investigated the effect of dopamine (DA) on inhibitory synaptic transmission in superficial layers of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) in prepubertal [postnatal age (P; days) 12&ndash;20], periadolescent (P30&ndash;48), and adult (P70&ndash;100) mice. The PFC is associated with higher-level cognitive functions, such as working memory, and is associated with initiation, planning, and execution of actions, as well as motivation and cognition. It is innervated by DA-releasing fibers that arise from the ventral tegmental area. In slices from prepubertal mice, DA produced a biphasic modulation of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) recorded in <I>layer II</I>/<I>III</I> pyramidal neurons. Activation of D2-like receptors leads to an early suppression of the evoked IPSC, which was followed by a longer-lasting facilitation of the IPSC mediated by D1-like DA receptors. In periadolescent mice, the D2 receptor-mediated early suppression was significantly smaller compared with the prepubertal animals and absent in adult animals. Furthermore, we found significant differences in the DA-mediated lasting enhancement of the inhibitory response among the developmental groups. Our findings suggest that behavioral paradigms that elicit dopaminergic release in the PFC differentially modulate inhibition of excitatory pyramidal neuron output in prepuberty compared with periadolescence and adulthood in the superficial layers (II/III) of the cortex.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Ethanol affects NMDA receptor signaling at climbing fiber-Purkinje cell synapses in mice and impairs cerebellar LTD]]></title>
<link>http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/109/5/1333?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Ethanol profoundly influences cerebellar circuit function and motor control. It has recently been demonstrated that functional <I>N</I>-methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are postsynaptically expressed at climbing fiber (CF) to Purkinje cell synapses in the adult cerebellum. Using whole cell patch-clamp recordings from mouse cerebellar slices, we examined whether ethanol can affect NMDA receptor signaling in mature Purkinje cells. NMDA receptor-mediated currents were isolated by bath application of the &alpha;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor antagonist 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzol[f]quinoxaline (NBQX). The remaining <scp>d</scp>-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (<scp>d</scp>-APV)-sensitive current was reduced by ethanol at concentrations as low as 10 mM. At a concentration of 50 mM ethanol, the blockade of <scp>d</scp>-APV-sensitive CF-excitatory postsynaptic currents was significantly stronger. Ethanol also altered the waveform of CF-evoked complex spikes by reducing the afterdepolarization. This effect was not seen when NMDA receptors were blocked by <scp>d</scp>-APV before ethanol wash-in. In contrast to CF synaptic transmission, parallel fiber (PF) synaptic inputs were not affected by ethanol. Finally, ethanol (10 mM) impaired long-term depression (LTD) at PF to Purkinje cell synapses as induced under control conditions by paired PF and CF activity. However, LTD induced by pairing PF stimulation with depolarizing voltage steps (substituting for CF activation) was not blocked by ethanol. These observations suggest that the sensitivity of cerebellar circuit function and plasticity to low concentrations of ethanol may be caused by an ethanol-mediated impairment of NMDA receptor signaling at CF synapses onto cerebellar Purkinje cells.</p>

<link>http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/109/5/1343?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can provide an index of intracortical excitability/inhibition balance. However, the neurochemical substrate of these measures remains unclear. Pharmacological studies suggest the involvement of GABA<SUB>A</SUB> and GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors in TMS protocols aimed at measuring intracortical inhibition, but this link remains inferential. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) permits measurement of GABA and glutamate + glutamine (Glx) concentrations in the human brain and might help in the direct empirical assessment of the relationship between TMS inhibitory measures and neurotransmitter concentrations. In the present study, MRS-derived relative concentrations of GABA and Glx measured in the left M1 of healthy participants were correlated with TMS measures of intracortical inhibition. Glx levels were found to correlate positively with TMS-induced silent period duration, whereas no correlation was found between GABA concentration and TMS measures. The present data demonstrate that specific TMS measures of intracortical inhibition are linked to shifts in cortical Glx, rather than GABA neurotransmitter levels. Glutamate might specifically interact with GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors, where higher MRS-derived Glx concentrations seem to be linked to higher levels of receptor activity.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Tactile stimulation of the hand evokes highly precise and repeatable patterns of activity in mechanoreceptive afferents; the strength (i.e., firing rate) and timing of these responses have been shown to convey stimulus information. To achieve an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the representation of tactile stimuli in the nerve, we developed a two-stage computational model consisting of a nonlinear mechanical transduction stage followed by a generalized integrate-and-fire mechanism. The model improves upon a recently published counterpart in two important ways. First, complexity is dramatically reduced (at least one order of magnitude fewer parameters). Second, the model comprises a saturating nonlinearity and therefore can be applied to a much wider range of stimuli. We show that both the rate and timing of afferent responses are predicted with remarkable precision and that observed adaptation patterns and threshold behavior are well captured. We conclude that the responses of mechanoreceptive afferents can be understood using a very parsimonious mechanistic model, which can then be used to accurately simulate the responses of afferent populations.</p>

<link>http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/109/5/1360?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>In this work we investigate in a computational model how cholinergic inputs to the olfactory bulb (OB) and piriform cortex (PC) modulate odor representations. We use experimental data derived from different physiological studies of ACh modulation of the bulbar and cortical circuitry and the interaction between these two areas. The results presented here indicate that cholinergic modulation in the OB significantly increases contrast and synchronization in mitral cell output. Each of these effects is derived from distinct neuronal interactions, with different groups of interneurons playing different roles. Both bulbar modulation effects contribute to more stable learned representations in PC, with pyramidal networks trained with cholinergic-modulated inputs from the bulb exhibiting more robust learning than those trained with unmodulated bulbar inputs. This increased robustness is evidenced as better recovery of memories from corrupted patterns and lower-concentration inputs as well as increased memory capacity.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>The properties of voltage-gated ion channels on the neuronal membrane shape electrical activity such as generation and backpropagation of action potentials, initiation of dendritic spikes, and integration of synaptic inputs. Subthreshold currents mediated by sodium channels are of interest because of their activation near rest, slow inactivation kinetics, and consequent effects on excitability. Modulation of these currents can also perturb physiological responses of a neuron that might underlie pathological states such as epilepsy. Using nucleated patches from the peri-somatic region of hippocampal CA1 neurons, we recorded a slowly inactivating component of the macroscopic Na<sup>+</sup> current (which we have called <I>I</I><SUB>NaS</SUB>) that shared many biophysical properties with the persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current, <I>I</I><SUB>NaP</SUB>, but showed distinctively faster inactivating kinetics. Ramp voltage commands with a velocity of 400 mV/s were found to elicit this component of Na<sup>+</sup> current reliably. <I>I</I><SUB>NaS</SUB> also showed a more hyperpolarized <I>I-V</I> relationship and slower inactivation than those of the fast transient Na<sup>+</sup> current (<I>I</I><SUB>NaT</SUB>) recorded in the same patches. The peak amplitude of <I>I</I><SUB>NaS</SUB> was proportional to the peak amplitude of <I>I</I><SUB>NaT</SUB> but was much smaller in amplitude. Hexanol, riluzole, and ranolazine, known Na<sup>+</sup> channel blockers, were tested to compare their effects on both <I>I</I><SUB>NaS</SUB> and <I>I</I><SUB>NaT</SUB>. The peak conductance of <I>I</I><SUB>NaS</SUB> was preferentially blocked by hexanol and riluzole, but the shift of half-inactivation voltage (<I>V</I><SUB>1/2</SUB>) was only observed in the presence of riluzole. Current-clamp measurements with hexanol suggested that <I>I</I><SUB>NaS</SUB> was involved in generation of an action potential and in upregulation of neuronal excitability.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p><I>N</I>-methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are heteromultimeric ion channels that contain an essential GluN1 subunit and two or more GluN2 (GluN2A&ndash;GluN2D) subunits. The biophysical properties and physiological roles of synaptic NMDA receptors are dependent on their subunit composition. In the basolateral amygdala (BLA), it has been suggested that the plasticity that underlies fear learning requires activation of heterodimeric receptors composed of GluN1/GluN2B subunits. In this study, we investigated the subunit composition of NMDA receptors present at synapses on principal neurons in the BLA. Purification of the synaptic fraction showed that both GluN2A and GluN2B subunits are present at synapses, and co-immunoprecipitation revealed the presence of receptors containing both GluN2A and GluN2B subunits. The kinetics of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents and pharmacological blockade indicate that heterodimeric GluN1/GluN2B receptors are unlikely to be present at glutamatergic synapses on BLA principal neurons. Selective RNA interference-mediated knockdown of GluN2A subunits converted synaptic receptors to a GluN1/GluN2B phenotype, whereas knockdown of GluN2B subunits had no effect on the kinetics of the synaptically evoked NMDA current. Blockade of GluN1/GluN2B heterodimers with ifenprodil had no effect, but knockdown of GluN2B disrupted the induction of CaMKII-dependent long-term potentiation at these synapses. These results suggest that, on BLA principal neurons, GluN2B subunits are only present as GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B heterotrimeric NMDA receptors. The GluN2B subunit has little impact on the kinetics of the receptor, but is essential for the recruitment of signaling molecules essential for synaptic plasticity.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Physical determinants of the shape of the psychophysical curve relating tactile roughness to raised-dot spacing: implications for neuronal coding of roughness]]></title>
<link>http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/109/5/1403?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>There are conflicting reports as to whether the shape of the psychometric relation between perceived roughness and tactile element spacing [spatial period (SP)] follows an inverted U-shape or a monotonic linear increase. This is a critical issue because the former result has been used to assess neuronal codes for roughness. We tested the hypothesis that the relation's shape is critically dependent on tactile element height (raised dots). Subjects rated the roughness of low (0.36 mm)- and high (1.8 mm)-raised-dot surfaces displaced under their fingertip. Inverted U-shaped curves were obtained as the SP of low-dot surfaces was increased (1.3&ndash;6.2 mm, tetragonal arrays); a monotonic increase was observed for high-dot surfaces. We hypothesized that roughness is not a single sensory continuum across the tested SPs of low-dot surfaces, predicting that roughness discrimination would show deviations from the invariant relation between threshold (S) and the value of the standard (S) surface (Weber fraction, S/S) expected for a single continuum. The results showed that Weber fractions were increased for SPs on the descending limb of the inverted U-shaped curve. There was also an increase in the Weber fraction for high-dot surfaces but only at the peak (3 mm), corresponding to the SP at which the slope of the psychometric function showed a modest decline. Together the results indicate that tactile roughness is not a continuum across low-dot SPs of 1.3&ndash;6.2 mm. These findings suggest that correlating the inverted U-shaped function with neuronal codes is of questionable validity. A simple intensive code may well contribute to tactile roughness.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Interaction of temporal and ordinal representations in movement sequences]]></title>
<link>http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/109/5/1416?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>The production of movement sequences requires an accurate control of muscle activation in time. How does the nervous system encode the precise timing of these movements? One possibility is that the timing of movements (temporal sequence) is an emergent property of the dynamic state of the nervous system and therefore intimately linked to a representation of the sequence of muscle commands (ordinal sequence). Alternatively, timing may be represented independently of the motor effectors and would be transferable to a new ordinal sequence. Some studies have found that a learned temporal sequence cannot be transferred to a new ordinal sequence, thus arguing for an integrated representation. Others have observed temporal transfer across movement sequences and have advocated an independent representation of temporal information. Using a modified serial reaction time task, we tested alternative models of the representation of temporal structure and the interaction between the output of separate ordinal and temporal sequence representations. Temporal transfer depended on whether a novel ordinal sequence was fixed within each test block. Our results confirm the presence of an independent representation of temporal structure and advocate a nonlinear multiplicative neural interaction of temporal and ordinal signals in the production of movements.</p>

<link>http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/109/5/1425?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Whenever the eyes move, spatial attention must keep track of the locations of targets as they shift on the retina. This study investigated transsaccadic updating of visual attention to cued targets. While observers prepared a saccade, we flashed an irrelevant, but salient, color cue in their visual periphery and measured the allocation of spatial attention before and after the saccade using a tilt discrimination task. We found that just before the saccade, attention was allocated to the cue's future retinal location, its predictively "remapped" location. Attention was sustained at the cue's location in the world across the saccade, despite the change of retinal position whereas it decayed quickly at the retinal location of the cue, after the eye landed. By extinguishing the color cue across the saccade, we further demonstrate that the visual system relies only on predictive allocation of spatial attention, as the presence of the cue after the saccade did not substantially affect attentional allocation. These behavioral results support and extend physiological evidence showing predictive activation of visual neurons when an attended stimulus will fall in their receptive field after a saccade. Our results show that tracking of spatial locations across saccades is a plausible consequence of physiological remapping.</p>

<link>http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/109/5/1435?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Cerebellum is a highly organized structure with a crystalline morphology that has always intrigued neuroscientists. Much of the cerebellar research has been conducted in anesthetized animals, particularly using ketamine/xylazine combination in rats. It is not clear how and to what extent the cerebellar cortical circuitry is affected by this anesthesia. In this study, we recorded spontaneous and evoked potentials from the cerebellar surface with chronically implanted, flexible-substrate, multielectrode arrays in rats and compared them to the signals simultaneously recorded from the motor cortex with similar electrodes. The power spectra and the intercontact coherence plots of the spontaneous activity in the awake-quiet animals extended up to 800 Hz in the cerebellum and only up to 200 Hz in the motor cortex. Ketamine/xylazine anesthesia suppressed most of the activity in the cerebellar cortex, which was in clear contrast to the motor cortex. In the awake cerebellum, large coherence values were observed between contact pairs as far apart as ~2 mm. Otherwise, there was not a discernable relation between the coherence and the intercontact distance. These results suggest that the surface electrodes can provide much more detailed information about the state of neural circuits when they are used on the cerebellar cortex compared with the cerebral areas. This may be due to the proximity of the molecular layer cells to the pial surface in the cerebellum.</p>

<link>http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/109/5/1444?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>It has been posited that a critical function of sleep is synaptic renormalization following a net increase in synaptic strength during wake. We hypothesized that wake would alter the resting-state functional organization of the brain and increase its metabolic cost. To test these hypotheses, two experiments were performed. In one, we obtained morning and evening resting-state functional MRI scans to assess changes in functional brain organization. In the second experiment, we obtained quantitative positron emission tomography measures of glucose and oxygen consumption to assess the cost of wake. We found selective changes in brain organization. Most prominently, bilateral medial temporal regions were locally connected in the morning but in the evening exhibited strong correlations with frontal and parietal brain regions involved in memory retrieval. We speculate that these changes may reflect aspects of memory consolidation recurring on a daily basis. Surprisingly, these changes in brain organization occurred without increases in brain metabolism.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Monitoring spike train synchrony]]></title>
<link>http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/109/5/1457?rss=1</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>Recently, the SPIKE-distance has been proposed as a parameter-free and timescale-independent measure of spike train synchrony. This measure is time resolved since it relies on instantaneous estimates of spike train dissimilarity. However, its original definition led to spuriously high instantaneous values for eventlike firing patterns. Here we present a substantial improvement of this measure that eliminates this shortcoming. The reliability gained allows us to track changes in instantaneous clustering, i.e., time-localized patterns of (dis)similarity among multiple spike trains. Additional new features include selective and triggered temporal averaging as well as the instantaneous comparison of spike train groups. In a second step, a causal SPIKE-distance is defined such that the instantaneous values of dissimilarity rely on past information only so that time-resolved spike train synchrony can be estimated in real time. We demonstrate that these methods are capable of extracting valuable information from field data by monitoring the synchrony between neuronal spike trains during an epileptic seizure. Finally, the applicability of both the regular and the real-time SPIKE-distance to continuous data is illustrated on model electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings.</p>

<title>Reading and writing the neural code</title>
<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~3/k9nAF6eu1WI/nn.3330</link>
<description>In this Perspective, the author examines how reading and writing the neural code may be linked. He reviews evidence defining the nature of neural coding of sensory input and asks how these constraints, particularly precise timing, might be critical for approaches that seek to ‘write the neural code’ through the artificial control of microcircuits to activate downstream structures.</description>

<description>The authors use Ca2+ imaging in freely behaving mice to look at the long-term dynamics of CA1 hippocampal place codes. They find that, in a familiar environment, there is substantial change in the population of place-coding cells over time, but the ensembles of these cells are sufficiently stable to preserve an accurate spatial representation across weeks.</description>

<p>Using Ca2+ imaging in freely behaving mice that repeatedly explored a familiar environment, we tracked thousands of CA1 pyramidal cells' place fields over weeks. Place coding was dynamic, as each day the ensemble representation of this environment involved a unique subset of cells. However, cells in the &#8764;15&#8211;25% overlap between any two of these subsets retained the same place fields, which sufficed to preserve an accurate spatial representation across weeks.</p>

<title>Specialized and independent processing of orientation and shape in visual field maps LO1 and LO2</title>
<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~3/QE8fuGhYstE/nn.3327</link>
<description>In the human brain, the lateral occipital area, which is thought to support object recognition, contains two separate visual field maps, LO1 and LO2. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, the authors identify the specialized and independent processing of orientation and shape in these two maps.</description>

<p>We identified human visual field maps, LO1 and LO2, in object-selective lateral occipital cortex. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we assessed the functions of these maps in the perception of orientation and shape. TMS of LO1 disrupted orientation, but not shape, discrimination, whereas TMS of LO2 disrupted shape, but not orientation, discrimination. This double dissociation suggests that specialized and independent processing of different visual attributes occurs in LO1 and LO2.</p>

<description>Despite substantial work highlighting the amygdala's role in fear, the authors provide a surprising finding that carbon dioxide inhalation evokes fear and panic in three patients with bilateral amygdala damage. These results indicate that the amygdala is not required for fear triggered internally rather than by external threats.</description>

<p>Decades of research have highlighted the amygdala's influential role in fear. We found that inhalation of 35% CO2 evoked not only fear, but also panic attacks, in three rare patients with bilateral amygdala damage. These results indicate that the amygdala is not required for fear and panic, and make an important distinction between fear triggered by external threats from the environment versus fear triggered internally by CO2.</p>

<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~3/qeI6Agk0s5U/nn.3321</link>
<description>The authors show that insulin induces long-term depression of excitatory synapses onto ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons in rodents, which requires endocannabinoid-mediated presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release. Insulin infusion into the VTA reduces food anticipatory behavior and conditioned place preference for food, suggesting a role for this plasticity in behavior.</description>

Here the authors show that perturbing excitatory backprojections from the hippocampus to the entorhinal cortex causes a gradual firing rate–dependent loss of grid pattern and an emergence of head-directional tuning in grid cells of the medial entorhinal cortex.</description>

<title>Recurrent inhibitory circuitry as a mechanism for grid formation</title>
<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~3/Ji-8Lw57hIo/nn.3310</link>
<description>Using paired recordings from rat entorhinal stellate cells and computational modeling, this study shows that stellate cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are almost exclusively connected to each other via inhibitory interneurons in an all-or-none style and that stable grid firing can arise from this recurrent inhibitory circuitry within the MEC.</description>

<title>Cellular mechanisms of spatial navigation in the medial entorhinal cortex</title>
<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~3/FsLiinMSoaw/nn.3340</link>
<description>The authors performed patch-clamp recordings in the entorhinal cortex of mice navigating in a virtual-reality environment. They found that the membrane potential pattern of stellate cells during firing field crossings consists of a slow depolarization driving spike output, which is reproduced by a continuous attractor network model of grid cell firing; phase precession of spiking, however, is best explained by an oscillatory interference model.</description>

<title>Experience-dependent modification of a central amygdala fear circuit</title>
<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~3/wULD1XSqswY/nn.3322</link>
<description>The authors show that fear conditioning induces potentiation of excitatory synapses onto somatostatin-positive inhibitory neurons in the lateral division of the central amygdala. Preventing this synaptic potentiation impairs the formation of fear memories, and activation of these neurons is necessary and sufficient for expression of fear memories.</description>

<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~3/UthsWkppqwg/nn.3328</link>
<description>A stimulus predicting reinforcement can trigger emotional and cognitive responses. Here the authors report that neurons in the amygdala integrate spatial and motivational information, potentially for directing attention toward emotionally relevant stimuli. This suggests that the amygdala may be important for coordination of cognitive and emotional responses.</description>

<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~3/4shZoaQWMwo/nn.3315</link>
<description>Using simultaneous electrocorticographical recordings in multiple lobes in human subjects performing memory retrieval tasks, this study finds that oscillatory coupling across a network of brain regions predicts successful memory recall. The study also shows that this increased network connectivity converges at the medial temporal lobe, with different neural signatures for spatial versus temporal components of episodic memory retrieval.</description>

<link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~3/kPQWHMt8-yM/nn.3324</link>
<description>Age-related cognitive decline is paralleled by two other prominent brain changes: structural atrophy prominent in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and disrupted non-rapid eye movement (NREM) slow-wave sleep (SWS). This study establishes an interaction between these factors, demonstrating that the extent of mPFC atrophy predicts the degree of impaired NREM SWS quality, thereby compromising hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation in the aging human brain.</description>
