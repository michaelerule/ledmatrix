# LED matrix

This is a collection of files related to hobbyist LED matrix display projects.
It includes Eagle format board design and schematic files, as well as
various helper scripts in Python and Jython for automatically preparing 
complex (e.g. Charlieplexed) layouts, or for generating and rendering 
compressed versions of bitmap fonts. There are numerous code examples for
driving multiplexed and charlieplexed individual LEDs or LED matrix elements.
This project includes some documents related to an Arduino-based
audio spectrum visualizer, a collaborative project with Joshua Holt. 
This project includes a persistence-of-vision LED bar project, a collaborative
project with Keegan McAllester. 

This code is uploaded to Github without curation or documentation in the hope
that some portions of it may be found useful. If there is community interest
in any portion or file within this project, please open an issue and the 
project maintainers will work to improve documentation and usability.
