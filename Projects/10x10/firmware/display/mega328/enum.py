Hello, I am searching for 3mm Cyan ( 505nm ) LEDs. Based on the picture of this item, it seems that this LED may be close to that wavelength, but it could also be that the color balance of the picture is off. What is the wavelength range and peak of this item? Do you have a datasheet? 

Do you know where I can find 505nm 3mm LEDs?
